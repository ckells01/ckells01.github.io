            <h2>
                Warlord Article for Heavy Metal Forces USA
            </h2>

            <p>
                If I were to compile a list of bands that <b>must</b> be loaded onto
                every iPod/iPhone/mp3 thingy, Warlord would be at the top of that list. This
                is metal at its finest and most regal, stuff that should be universally loved
                instead of a secret pleasure to a fortunate few…
            </p>

            <p>
                Funny how small things connect to big things and create something that sticks in the mind
                and heart. I shan’t trot out the hackneyed “soundtrack of your life” thing
                here, but I do believe that music can “take you back” and stir up very specific
                memories of time, place, event, emotion…for me, Warlord hits hard on that
                latter theme and always makes me think of my Dad…

            <h3>Amazing Discovery</h3>

            <div>

                <p>
                    Back in
                    the day, my pals and I considered Metal Blade one of the few reliable labels
                    (and generally more consistent than Noise and Combat in quality of releases).
                    If we saw a band on Metal Blade, we’d take a chance on it (and were often
                    rewarded for such exploration). Trouble was, we couldn’t always find the albums
                    in our little corner of Virginia, but we did have remarkable luck with a store
                    called Music Man. In those archaic days before the Interwebs, having such a
                    solid “pipeline of metal” was a blessing indeed, and that place got much money
                    from me and my metal buddies (Sean, Thomas, Danile, Bud).
                </p>

                <p>
                    With few resources for digging up information on new metal, we discovered lots of bands
                    by dipping into the label’s <b>Metal Massacre</b> compilations (on
                    good old-school cassettes). Missed the first one, but 1982’s <b>MMII</b> had
                    some pretty decent stuff on it, particularly the opening track on side two by a
                    band we’d never heard of, some dudes with the promising name of Warlord.
                    Getting that prime slot to start off either side of a cassette was a good deal
                    in those pre-CD days, and “Lucifer’s Hammer” absolutely knocked me for a loop…that
                    central riff was golden, the vocal refrains were unexpected and maddeningly
                    memorable, and the infectious bass drum pattern kicked my nascent drumming
                    instincts into high gear. The tune instantly became required daily listening
                    for me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Somehow, the
                    original release of <b>MMIII</b> slipped by me, but God bless my
                    wacky neighbor (also named Chris) for finding a copy of the “dual-length”
                    cassette with <b>MMII</b> <i>and</i> <b>MMIII</b> on it…and
                    look out, here’s more Warlord! (That in itself was a great sign—other than
                    Bitch and Malice, bands simply did not show up twice on these omnibus albums.)
                    Again, the band delivered a song that stood far above any other track on those
                    compilations. The manic drumming and insane guitarwork on “Mrs. Victoria”
                    instilled in me an almost frantic desire…must learn more about this band, must
                    find anything and everything else they have released, must rock out to Warlord
                    at all times. Sheer delight indeed to finally discover (again, life was just
                    far too tough without the magic of Google) that Warlord had released an EP
                    called <b>Deliver Us</b>…but where to get it? Could not find it
                    anywhere…Music Man, always so reliable for stocking Metal Blade stuff, never
                    had it (not that I saw, anyway).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then, on a routine trip to Tower Mall (lousy mall, but they often had sneakers to fit my
                    big ol’ feet), I had a quick minute to check out Record Bar (not the best shop
                    but it’s all Tower had)…and behold, miracles do happen – there was a
                    single copy of <b>Deliver Us</b> hidden in the racks of the “rock”
                    section (no dedicated metal section, of course). No chance to buy the tape on
                    the spot, but just finding it was enough, and it immediately became a matter of
                    “how can I get back to this store ASAP”…
                </p>

            </div>

            <h3>Emotional Connection</h3>

            <div>

                <p>
                    So I did
                    what any desperate, 13-year-old metalhead would do: commence Operation Hassle
                    My Dad. Even at this early stage of my musical development, metal was not very
                    popular with the parental side of my house (on more than one occasion, my tapes
                    and records “went away” – best of intentions but it sure was a major drag). But
                    Dad was always a little more indulgent with music…he would let me rock out in
                    the car, secretly liked Iron Maiden songs like “Aces High” and dug some of the
                    amazing drumming that early 80s metal bands were producing. So after enduring
                    some earnest pestering, Dad agreed to haul me over to Record Bar on a school
                    night (virtually unheard of for us) – just the two of us, just to get my
                    “deliverance”…
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ride. Park. Resist urge to sprint through mall to record store. Search breathlessly
                    through racks of tapes…and finally <b>Deliver Us</b> is mine, a
                    bargain at $6.98 since its worth turned out to be infinite. Back to the car and
                    pop that tape in the player…Metal Blade was “famous” for nonexistent packaging;
                    this release was no different, as the tape inlay lacked lyrics, photos and
                    anything more than a simple listing of the band members and a contact
                    address. Nothing to do but sit back and soak in the music…
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first
                    tune, “Deliver Us From Evil”, established some cool atmosphere as the
                    intro built up, and when the drums kicked in with the march-style
                    cadence, it was all magic. Sometimes music just sounds “right” to the ear,
                    and all the parts fall into place, with guitars and drums complementing each other
                    in perfect harmony and vocals weaving melodies that are both comfortably
                    familiar and intriguingly fresh…Warlord had it all, and what an awesome
                    experience it was to hear this for the first time, with no idea what was coming
                    next or what twists and turns the songs would take – there really is no
                    repeating the fascination of the very first encounter with a new album…
                </p>

                <p>
                    And it was
                    even cooler that Dad was feeling it with me…he was totally on board with the
                    drumming (with me as a burgeoning skinsman, Dad was just as keyed in on Thunder
                    Child as I was) and was probably relieved that the songs seemed to be laying
                    down positive lyrics…hard to beat something as overt as “deliver us from evil”,
                    right? “Child of the Damned” was trickier on that front, but the rumble of the
                    double-bass drums overcame any objections…we jammed all the way home and almost
                    made it through the whole album.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That whole
                    excursion was golden, probably due in some part to the events of the evening as
                    a whole…with kids of my own now, I look back and realize what a truly righteous
                    “Dad move” it was for my Dad to take me on that Warlordian mission, an errand
                    that surely meant nothing to him. It’s a strikingly clear memory from that
                    early teen period of my life, and I just hope that I have the “fatherly sense”
                    to seize such a seemingly simple opportunity to make a lasting memory with my
                    sons, turning something as mundane as a trip to the mall into a moment that
                    they’ll carry with them for the rest of their lives. Ultimately, the direct
                    emotional connection that these songs represent is a key aspect of my 30-year
                    affection for Warlord. Though I’ve now got copies of Warlord on just about
                    every format (cassette, LP, CD, DVD), I still have my original <b>Deliver
                        Us</b> cassette from Tower Mall and have no plans to ever get rid of it.

            <h3>Pervasive Impact</h3>

            <div>

                <p>
                    Not that
                    the tape has much life in it, anymore…man, I wore that thing out. I dug deeper
                    into the EP and found it nearly flawless (other than overall length 8^). It was
                    one of those rare musical discoveries that has a pervasive impact…my circle of
                    knucklehead metalpals simply had to hear this, so the tape made the rounds
                    (oddly enough, we traded vast quantities of metal in the parking lot at our
                    church). My buddy Sean was particularly blown away; we were just starting off as
                    young drummers, so we had plenty to emulate with the mighty Thunder Child. We
                    both had low-rent “first drumset” five-piece kits, but Warlord just wasn’t
                    happening with only one bass drum, so we arranged a “combination weekend” and
                    put our kits together specifically to try playing “Lucifer’s Hammer” on the
                    megakit (we knew better than to attempt “Child” or “Mrs. Victoria”). We
                    probably tried out “Black Mass” as well, working on that classic bouncy rhythm
                    on the ride cymbal…
                </p>

                <p>
                    “Lucifer’s
                    Hammer” became my default song for putting at the end of any dub tapes I made;
                    it was so nice and compact (just shy of 3.5 minutes, if you trim the outro)
                    that it always seemed to fit at the end of one side or the other on a 90-minute
                    blank. I figured you could never hear that song too many times. “Mrs. Victoria”
                    got a lot of play as well…the cassette placed this track at the start of side
                    2, which really fixed it as a “middle track” in my personal running order (for
                    me, it was never a bonus track tacked on the end). I maintain that track order
                    to this day – when I added <b>Deliver Us</b> to my iPhone, I adjusted
                    the sequence to place “Mrs. Victoria” as track four so that the album ends with
                    “the hammer” and then comes full circle as the quiet acoustic guitar fadeout
                    echoes the album’s intro and provides the perfect way to close this first
                    chapter of Warlordian history…
                </p>

                <p>
                    But
                    “Winter Tears” may have been the dark horse as “favorite” from that EP
                    (hard to choose when there are no weak tracks)…there was an air of melancholy
                    emanating from that song, but instead of making it a depressing or syrupy
                    ballad, it seemed to give the song extra power, and from a musical standpoint
                    the tune had everything you could want – dense rhythmic layers (I am a
                    sucker for acoustic strumming over an electric riff), haunting guitar and vocal
                    melodies, a tailor-made drum part, the perfect use of keyboards to augment and
                    support without overpowering…it was the total package and made me wonder how
                    the band would ever top this record…
                </p>

                <p>
                    By this
                    time, Warlord had released their second album, bearing the rocking title
                    of <b>…And the Cannons of Destruction Have Begun</b>. This one seemed
                    easier to find, so we all snagged copies to see what sort of metallic wizardry
                    the band had conjured up. Again, there was no real packaging on the cassette,
                    but we noticed that there were some different band members, most importantly a
                    new singer. Also, it seemed odd that fully half of the “new” album was just
                    rerecorded versions of tunes from <b>Deliver Us</b>. I guess we were a
                    little thick-headed about things, as we were slow to realize that the “video
                    soundtrack” subtitle actually meant this was something of a “live” album.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Cannons</b> was
                    somewhat of a mixed bag for me. It was pretty cool to hear live versions of
                    great songs like “Hammer” and “Child”, and there were some interesting new
                    touches (I liked the bass-drum flutters in the breakdown after the lead on
                    “Hammer”). But the production seemed a little muddy, somehow less bright…and
                    the vocals were not quite as convincing on that older material.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But fresh
                    tunes like “Lost and Lonely Days” and “Aliens” were excellent…the vocals worked
                    well on the new stuff, possibly because those songs were written for that
                    voice. Bill Tsamis’ guitar was instantly recognizable – something about his
                    tone, the chords he used, the melodies he spun, it was all definitely unique.
                    And the drumming…well, Mark Zonder kicked it up several notches, consistently
                    incorporating more syncopation and subtle grooves into his playing and giving
                    the drums an even more prominent voice in shaping the songs. (No surprise that
                    he ended up doing the same in Fates Warning, constantly pushing the boundaries
                    of what the “rhythm section” could do.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Can’t
                    recall exact sequence or timing here (hey, gimme a break – it was a long time
                    ago, after all 8^), but I know that my enthusiasm for Warlord was riding high,
                    and I dashed off a letter to the Battle Choir address inside the cassette’s
                    inlay card. How unbelievably cool to get a letter back from Warlord
                    Productions! It was only a single page, but just getting a response back was
                    enough to escalate my “fanboy mode” into overdrive. Even better, there
                    seemed to be more activity in the Warlord camp, as the letter mentioned the
                    release of “Aliens” as a single and offered a chance to get the band’s live
                    concert video. No shirts, though (how awesome would it have been to snag a
                    tshirt with that giant W on it)…
                </p>

                <p>
                    Man, that
                    VHS was heavy temptation…never could get the dollars together to order one, and
                    knew better than to put it on a Christmas or birthday list. Fortunately,
                    Sean’s buddy Big Bill got a copy of the VHS, so I did get a chance to see the
                    thing. It was not an actual live performance in front of an audience, but cool
                    stuff just the same (although I would’ve preferred a dedicated drum cam for
                    some more Zonder action 8^). In those days before YouTube and such, we were
                    just happy to see the band in any way we could…sure, a tour of the east coast
                    would have been great, but we knew enough to take what we could get. Aside from
                    the songs, it was tremendously exciting to hear Tsamis speak about forthcoming
                    Warlord songs…just titles like “Battle of the Living Dead” and “Lost Archangel”
                    and “Thy Kingdom Come” were enough to make me and my buddies drool at the
                    thought of how massive the next album was going to be…
                </p>

            </div>

            <h3>Enduring Presence</h3>

            <div>

                <p>
                    Unfortunately,
                    the band could not get the necessary traction to keep the Warlord machine
                    rolling, something that may not really make sense to those who’ve never been in
                    a band. We never stopped listening to them, though…those were the golden years
                    for “the Metal Blade bands” like Warlord, Fates Warning, Omen, Lizzy Borden,
                    but many of those groups cycled down or changed as 1987/88 hit. I graduated
                    from high school in `88, and snippets from both “Winter Tears” and “Lost and Lonely
                    Days” were on my short list for my quotation in the senior yearbook. Odd that a
                    metal band as righteous as Warlord had so many songs with powerful themes of
                    loss, but it did make me realize I was neither tearful nor heartbroken about
                    leaving my high school. (For what it’s worth, I ended up using a Dio quote: “We
                    are sunlight, we can sparkle and shine, and the dreams are what we’re made
                    of…”)

                    Still, it
                    was a major drag to lose such a mighty band after so few albums; clearly
                    Warlord was primed to create a long-lasting legacy (and I would argue that they
                    have done just that, despite the obvious dearth of output). At the time, I was
                    simply grateful that Zonder quickly surfaced in Fates Warning and got to
                    use his ridiculous skills on a pile of their albums (although I admit absolute
                    and total preference for the John Arch era of that band). I think it’s great
                    that many folks know him as “the drummer from Fates” but I will always think of
                    him as “that guy from Warlord – Thunder Child.” And even though Tsamis dropped
                    out of music for a while (at least publicly), it was gratifying to see some of
                    those “lost Warlord” songs eventually appear on his Lordian Guard albums. The
                    LG material had those same wonderful Tsamis melodies but always felt more like
                    a project than a band, making me wonder what glory might have come to pass if
                    Warlord had managed that elusive third record.

                    Of course,
                    they <i>did</i> eventually release <b>Rising Out of the Ashes</b>,
                    with the Tsamis/Zonder core intact and firing on all cylinders…I am convinced
                    that this album would not have worked without both of those guys in place.
                    Warlord has earned enough of a following that bands sometimes will do cover
                    versions of their stuff; HammerFall and October 31 come to mind (and my pal
                    Danile did a very cool acoustic cover of “Deliver Us From Evil”). But it’s not
                    really about playing the riff or nailing the drum fills…seems to me that the
                    pairing of Tsamis and Zonder produces something that defies duplication. Hey,
                    I’d love to get into a band and work out a cover of “Lucifer’s Hammer” or
                    something. It would be gangs of fun, but even the most note-accurate rendition
                    would fall short of what Warlord is…for now, I am content thrashing away in the
                    basement doing my best Thunder Child impression, and smiling just a little each
                    Sunday when we get to some specific parts of the Lord’s Prayer…

                    One final
                    note…I actually <b><i>am</i></b> Thunder Child these days, or at
                    least I have borrowed the name. For some six years and counting, I’ve been a
                    “big brave” in the Y Guides program, a YMCA offering modeled on Native American
                    principles to involve fathers in raising their children. Dads and kids form
                    tribes, and each member gets to choose a “tribal name” and decorate a necklace
                    with same. My older son chose to be Flying Eagle, and my youngest is Crazy
                    Horse. The kids are in separate tribes, and it’s probably no surprise that I am
                    known in both circles as Thunder Child (but am <i>not</i> known for
                    having any kind of drawing ability). It literally makes me smile when we are
                    doing Y Guides activities and have to say our Indian names…”Thunder Child
                    here”…to date, no one has recognized the Warlordian reference, but I keep the
                    faith, always keep the faith…
