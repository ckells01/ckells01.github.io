            Top 5 Metal Albums of 2017
        </h2>>

        <p>2017 had some fantastic metal releases, so any list of "Top 5" albums will surely leave out some great music.
            I based many of my choices on bands that I was fortunate enough to see perform live this year. In no
            particular order, here are 5 gems from 2017...</p>

        <p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><b><u>Fates Warning – Awaken the Guardian Live</u></b></p>

        <p>To my ears, the John Arch era of Fates Warning is untouchable, and "Awaken" is an eternal album for me -
            probably Top 5 of all time, maybe Top 3. I've listened to the studio version literally thousands of times,
            so getting to see the original lineup perform the entire album at the 2016 ProgPower festival was
            essentially a religious experience. This live package captures that ProgPower show, as well as the Keep It
            True concert, on CD/DVD/Blu-Ray and is the ideal anniversary gift to celebrate 30 years of a magical metal
            milestone. There's a heavy emotional component to this music, and it is testament to the lasting and
            timeless nature of truly special songs that capture a moment in time and preserve it perfectly</p>

        <p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><b><u>Night Demon – Darkness Remains</u></b></p>

        <p>I discovered Night Demon as part of Ragnarokkr Metal Apocalypse in 2014 and have watched them become a truly
            lethal live band. In light of their nonstop touring schedule, it seems strange that this is only their
            second album. But somehow the California trio has managed to play hundreds of shows (I caught 10 of them)
            whilst preparing a sophomore release that rivals – and just might surpass – the band's tremendous debut.
            This collection of songs is tight, focused, catchy, heavy, melodic, diverse, even experimental (check the
            title track for a haunting album closer that is as effective as it is unexpected). In short, this album is
            everything that makes an old-school metal fan smile while shaking a fist with sheer delight.</p>

        <p><b>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><b><u>Mega Colossus – Hyperglaive</u></b></p>

        <p> (Vinyl 2016, CD 2017)
            Calling themselves "adventure metal" and adding "Mega" to their name for this album, these NC metallers have
            released their finest record yet, which is no mean feat given the strength of their previous work. Many of
            these songs have been in the band's formidable live set for several years, so finally getting proper studio
            versions was long overdue. Staying true to lyrical themes that delve into sci-fi and literary realms, this
            batch of tunes blends classic metal influences with ambitious song constructions, shifting riffs and endless
            melodies, delivering a truly massive (mega?) album that should be on every metalhead's playlist. These guys
            are fresh off a successful European tour and looking to get on the spring/summer fest schedule next year, so
            Hyperglaive literally should be the album that spawns the band's worldwide breakout.
        </p>

        <p><b>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><b><u>Walpyrgus – Walpyrgus Nights</u></b></p>

        <p>Most of the songs on this album have been around since Walpyrgus started playing local shows back around
            2014, so I'd heard them dozens of times before this album finally arrived. (In fact, "She Lives" is the only
            track that has not yet appeared in any live sets I've seen.) Fortunately, this album benefits from a lush
            production that ensures the tunes transfer to record smoothly. Simply put, this album is 100% fun,
            effortlessly harnessing the energy of vintage punk with the melodic sensibilities of traditional metal to
            produce infectious songs that get stuck in the brain after only a single listen (and then cemented there by
            many subsequent spins). These guys have already made appearances at US fests like Frost & Fire and Legions
            of Metal, but I'm quite sure they'll be moving to the European stage soon.</p>

        <p><b>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><b><u>The Night Flight Orchestra – Amber Galactic</u></b></p>

        <p>So here's a band I've not seen live - yet. I know nothing about Soilwork or Arch Enemy (the main bands of
            some NFO members) and did not notice NFO's first few albums, but hearing "Gemini" off this album caught my
            attention immediately...and I'm so glad that it did. This is marvelous melodic hard rock that embodies the
            musical spirit of 70s and 80s AOR yet doesn't sound like a lame throwback. Yes, it somehow sounds familiar
            and fresh at the same time - hugely memorable choruses layered over finely crafted songs that are still
            running on a continuous loop in my head. I'd love to see these guys make a US run next year, but even if
            they don't, I guess 2018 will be the year that I dig into their first two albums.</p>
