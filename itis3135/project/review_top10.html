    <h2>
      Top 10 Metal Albums Growing Up
    </h2>

    <p><b><span>My Heavy Metal</span></b></p>

    <p>It’s difficult to capture a list of only 10 albums that guided my musical development. There
      are so many records that were huge influences on those early years, so
      narrowing it down meant leaving out game-changing or critical albums by bands
      like Omen, Anthrax, Queen, Lizzy Borden, Dio, Hall and Oates, King Diamond,
      Flotsam &amp; Jetsam, and many others. Oddly, I never did much with Priest or
      Sabbath or Kiss or Scorpions or any of those standard “entry points” to a life
      of metal. Instead I started with a more “radio rock” diet before moving into
      the heavy side of things. So here’s a chronological attempt to map out the
      evolution of a U.S. metalhead in the early 80s…</p>

    <p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><b><u>Styx – Paradise Theater (Released 1981)</u></b></p>

    <p>Styx was the first band that I fell completely in love with. I was 10 when this
      album came out, and I bought the LP on a family beach trip. I couldn’t listen
      to it for a week until we got back home, so I just looked at the laser etching
      of the band logo on the B side and thought about how cool it looked. Uncountable
      listenings to the album revealed a fine blend of hit singles (“Too Much Time on
      My Hands”) and more rocking tunes (“Half-Penny, Two-Penny”), with a great
      intro/outro theme bookending the entire album. I immediately explored the Styx
      back catalog and found so much awesome music, especially from their early years
      on Wooden Nickel Records. John Panozzo was an early drumming influence, and
      Styx is still a mainstay in my listening rotation even today.</p>

    <p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><b><u>Asia – Asia (Released 1982)</u></b></p>

    <p>For me, this is the only Asia album that matters, even though this “original”
      lineup made various attempts to reform and recapture the magic of this debut.
      Oddly, I’m not really a fan of Yes or ELP or any of the related projects by the
      band members, but the style of this album just works for me. Sure, it’s heavy
      on pop song structures and lacks any real progressive adventurousness. But the
      “radio hits” are good, simple fun (especially “Sole Survivor”), and deeper cuts
      like “Without You” are wonderfully moody. The follow-up album was decent at
      best, so this first record is pretty much the best Asia out there for me.</p>

    <p><b>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><b><u>Def Leppard – On Through the Night (Released 1980, discovered 1983)</u></b></p>

    <p>Thanks to U.S. rock radio, it was hard to avoid <b>Pyromania</b> when it came out. I liked
      that album a lot, and quickly discovered that <b>High n Dry</b> was even
      better. But then I found <b>OTTN</b> and it was immediately my favorite. There
      was some radio-friendly stuff, but heavier offerings like “Wasted” and “When
      the Walls Came Tumbling Down” are terrific, and closer “Overture” displays an
      epic NWOBHM flair that is sorely missed from the band’s later work. I always
      wanted to do a cover version of “Answer to the Master” in a band, but no luck
      so far.</p>

    <p><b>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><b><u>Warlord – Deliver Us (Released1983)</u></b></p>

    <p>After hearing Warlord on <b>Metal Massacre 2 and 3</b>, I searched for this EP and
      eventually found the cassette (the only copy of it I ever saw in a store). What
      a perfect collection of musical beauty…a brilliant atmospheric opening,
      carefully constructed songs, golden guitar melodies, thoughtful and precise
      drumming, and a smooth acoustic outro to bring it all full circle. This album
      really did capture a singular moment in time, something that the band has been
      challenged to recapture on subsequent efforts. One of the first double-bass
      rhythms I tried to play was the “Lucifer’s Hammer” lick – my best friend and I
      combined our drum sets and gave it our best try!</p>

    <p><b>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><b><u>Triumph – Thunder Seven (Released 1984)</u></b>
    </p>

    <p>I’ve loved Triumph forever, and earlier albums like <b>Never Surrender</b> are
      undeniable classics. But for some reason, <b>Thunder Seven</b> was the Triumph record
      that I kept going back to, even though the main “hit singles” were sung by
      drummer Gil Moore (as I’ve always preferred Rik Emmett’s vocals). On this
      album, it was the lesser tracks that hooked me…”Time Goes By” and “Killing
      Time” and “Stranger in a Strange Land” made for a perfect Side 2, and even the
      more commercial tunes were quite good. I missed this tour but caught them on
      the next one in 1986 (with Yngwie Malmsteen as the opening act).</p>

    <p><b>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><b><u>Iron Maiden – Powerslave (Released 1984)</u></b>
    </p>

    <p>This album was my first real move into heavier stuff, and this remains my favorite
      album of all time. I’d heard Maiden before, and Nicko’s brilliant drumming on <b>Piece
        of Mind</b> immediately caught my ear. I picked up <b>Powerslave</b> when it
      came out and was stunned at how perfectly assembled the album was. Every song
      was a gem, the guitars and vocals were on fire, and the drumming was absolutely
      untouchable. I can’t imagine how many times I’ve listened to this, on every
      format from LP to digital, often whilst air-drumming like a madman. Garage
      bands would later let me take a shot at “Aces High” (along with standards like
      “The Trooper”), and this is the album I return to when I want to revisit the purely
      focused energy of a band at its pinnacle. </p>

    <p><b>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><b><u>Metal Massacre V (Released 1984)</u></b></p>

    <p>Volume VII is probably my favorite of the Metal Massacre compilations, but Volume V
      was the gateway to so many amazing bands. Omen and Attacker quickly became key
      parts of my growing metal spectrum (those first three Omen records are unbelievable),
      and Over Kill’s debut was a true monster. But the two key discoveries for me on
      MMV were Fates Warning and Metal Church. I ended up finding both debut albums
      during a family trip to California – I got to visit a big record store (bigger
      than the ones in my city) and was delighted to find both <b>Night on Brocken</b>
      and <b>Metal Church</b>. (I still have those cassettes 8^)</p>

    <p'><b>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><b><u>Over Kill – Feel the Fire (Released 1985)</u></b></p>

      <p>It’s hard to pick which early thrash album hit me the hardest. It was really a
        three-way tie between Metal Church’s self-titled debut, Anthrax’s <b>Spreading
          the Disease</b>, and this Over Kill album. (I didn’t appreciate the first two
        Megadeth albums until much later.) I stole lots of drumming licks (and endless
        inspiration) from all three records, but I think it was Rat Skates’ frantic
        energy that made the Over Kill songs stand out. Trying to match his driving
        right hand was a lesson in drumming stamina. The “punk rock” edge was still
        alive in the band at the time, and these songs seem to ride the hard line
        between finely honed aggression and loss of cohesive control. But this first
        album remains the best Over Kill for me, and it’s the one I always return to
        for my fix of frenetic metallic gold.</p>

      <p><b>9.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><b><u>Yngwie Malmsteen – Marching Out (Released 1985)</u></b></p>

      <p>I remember hearing “As Above, So Below” (from the first album) on the Metal Shop
        program that my local radio station ran once a week. That neoclassical sound
        was brand new to me, and it was immediately appealing. When <b>Marching Out</b>
        landed, it had a completely different sound from most of what else I was
        listening to. I never really went for the instrumentals on this album (preferring
        the ones on the first record), but Jeff Scott Soto’s massive vocal presence
        guaranteed that the lyric songs were killer. Side 2 of this album is still my
        favorite – every song just rules. I was bummed out when JSS left for the <b>Trilogy</b>
        album – I didn’t much like that third album, but I went to the tour anyway and
        was ecstatic when JSS showed up as the vocalist!</p>

      <p><b>10.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><b><u>Fates Warning – Awaken the Guardian (Released 1986)</u></b></p>

      <p>This is a band with distinct eras, and I am firmly in the John Arch camp. These
        first three albums are legendary, and <b>Awaken</b> barely edges out <b>The Spectre
          Within</b> as my ultimate favorite. This one blew me away on all fronts – the
        music was heavy yet seriously challenging (it was hard work to play along to
        these songs on a garage drum set). And the lyrics were engaging and complex,
        worthy of study and exploration. Arch’s voice is purely magical here, and I
        consider myself fortunate to have “been there” when this album was released so
        I could spend a full 30 years adoring every moment of every song. There’s a
        deep emotional attachment to this album and these songs…when I saw Arch/Matheos
        in 2012, they played a handful of these old classics, and I freely admit both
        that I got overwhelmed with tears of joy and that I was not the only one to
        feel such a wet-eyed wave of amazement. This experience was repeated (and
        exceeded) when I saw this 1986 lineup perform in September 2016. To witness the
        entire <b>Awaken</b> album plus “Damnation” plus Side 2 of <b>Spectre</b> was a
        rare privilege, and I can only hope and pray that John Arch finds another spark
        within his heart so that he can once again grace us with his vocal brilliance.</p>
