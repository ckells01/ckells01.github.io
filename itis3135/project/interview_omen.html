            Interview with Omen for Heavy Metal Forces USA: Return of the Metal Warriors
        </h2>

        <p>April 2001</p>

        <p>
            When I heard that Omen had reformed in 1996, I was absolutely delighted. The band's first three records,
            released back in the early and mid-80s, are certified metal classics, and <b><i>Warning of Danger</i></b> is
            truly one of my favorite records. But the album produced by the 90s version of
            Omen was ultimately disappointing, with a modern sound that strayed from the
            epic, melodic metal that the band offered on albums like <b><i>The Curse</i></b>.
            I was relieved to learn that Omen guitarist Kenny Powell was unhappy with the
            "new Omen” and that he wanted to get back to the classic metal sound of the 80s albums.
            Now, armed with a new singer and a burning commitment to old school Omen metal,
            the band is back to what they do best: creating brilliant epic metal for the legions
            of Omen fans worldwide. Kenny took some time from his busy recording schedule
            to talk to me about the band's history, their return to metal glory on their forthcoming record, and the
            bright future that is ahead for these metal warriors. Read on to learn just about anything you ever
            wanted to know about Omen!<br>Into the arena...
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>You're recording your new album now, right? How's that going?</b></span><br>
            Yes, we're in the middle of recording <b><i>Eternal Black Dawn </i></b>right now. Let's see, as we speak,
            drum tracks are fairly well finished, bass tracks are finished, and I'm working on rhythm guitars. I'm
            trying to get back to doing something that I can really be proud of and
            something that's a little bit more original Omen.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>Back to the old school?</b></span><br>
            Yeah, back to the old school, because the old school
            was pretty damn fun, you know? It's pretty easy sometimes to get
            caught up in trying to be cool or trying to be "now," and sometimes you just
            have to do what you do best. You're better off, and I haven't done what I do
            best, really, since <b><i>The Curse</i></b>, as far as I'm concerned.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>I can see that. That record was the pinnacle probably...</b></span><br>
            It was for me, because we had a nice budget, we did
            most of the record at Capitol Records, we had 48 tracks. I wasn't really
            rushed, and I could sit down and really work on my guitar playing and the
            songwriting. That was probably the pinnacle record for me, for sure.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>The record sounded great. You and Bill Metoyer worked on that one
                    together.</b></span><br>
            Me and Bill were bros, and we may try to bring Bill
            out to mix this new one. It depends on finances and time constraints. We've
            talked a couple of times, and if the point comes where we're ready to mix and
            he's not in the middle of something, we're going to fly him out and try to mix
            this thing together. I'd really love to work with him again.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>So you guys are doing the record in your own studio. That's a
                    pretty nice luxury to have at this point in your career.</b></span><br>
            It is a luxury, and it's taken several years to evolve
            it to the point where it's starting to turn into a pretty cool little studio.
            After this record is done, I'm probably going to start recording some other
            bands.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>Would you produce them yourself?</b></span><br>
            Yeah! I love producing. Sometimes I think I love
            producing more than playing; it's a whole different thing. I'm a lot more
            relaxed as a producer, sitting there and being objective to the whole overall
            thing. When I'm just playing, I'm a lot more hyper and I'm not as objective.
            There's probably a point at some time where I might get heavily into producing,
            but I still want to play for a few more years. We've been writing the cool
            stuff that's…well, I'm not going to say it's going to sound <i>exactly</i> like
            <b><i>Battle Cry</i></b>, but it's more technical and it's more musical and
            more of that same theme. Might have a little more crunch to it, might be a
            little crisper, but I think the old fans are really going to like this thing.

        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>Great! More of the old style!</b></span><br>
            Yeah, more of the old style, not letting anybody else
            telling me what to play, and just playing. I guess I'm a little more of a dick
            on this record! [laughs] Because I tried to compromise for two or three
            records, and I can look back on it, the last 10 years or whatever that I
            played, and I'm like, "Y'know, when I was a lot more headstrong…" I'm proud of
            those older records, and I didn't really know if anybody else really cared about
            the damn things, you know? And I've started to see lately that there are people
            out there who are like, "I grew up on this" or "I still listen to it everyday,"
            and it's like, "Whoah!" It kind of reinforced my thoughts of what kind of music
            I should be playing.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>Why do you think that old the old Omen stuff is so enduring? Because
                    those are classic records in a lot of circles, particularly Europe...</b></span><br>
            Oh yeah, Europe…I was shocked, because I didn't know.
            We never played Europe when the classic Omen lineup was together. We were
            supposed to go two or three times, and little piddly shit knocked us out at the
            last minute. So I really had no clue until we went over in `97 with the <b><i>Reopening the Gates</i></b>
            record, and all of a sudden every night at the bus there are
            50 or 60 kids with everything from demo tapes of stuff that I forgot I ever
            wrote to every record. And young kids, 18- and 19-year-old kids were like "Omen
            rules!" And I thought, "Wow, I didn't waste all those long nights in the
            studio, writing songs and eating Top Ramen. Somebody actually did care."
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>Have you got a record label lined up to release <i>Eternal Black
                        Dawn</i>?</b></span><br>
            We're not quite sure what we're going to do yet. We're
            going to finish it on our own, and then go for the best deal. It's not going to
            be a problem getting a deal. There's a couple of things that we could
            definitely do right now, but last time we didn't really get the record out in
            the U.S., it was a European-only thing. We've talked to Metal Blade a little
            bit; there may be a possibility of going back there. Whatever we do, I want to
            make sure there's distribution in the U.S. and in Europe.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>And you toured Europe briefly in support of <i>Reopening the Gates</i>.
                    That was when you were on Massacre Records.</b></span><br>
            Yeah, we went with Fates Warning. I think we did about
            23 shows. It was a cool tour, and we had a great time. It was great to get over
            to Europe and see all the kids, all the young kids who had Omen records. It
            tripped me out! Like I said, we were supposed to go twice in the 80s, but
            little technical things knocked us out, so it was a long time coming. I wish I
            could've gotten there a lot sooner.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>Did you have a tough time deciding what to play when you were over there?
                    I know you wanted to promote the new record, but the old stuff...</b></span><br>
            Well, we started out playing about half of the new
            record, <b><i>Reopening the Gates</i></b>, and about half old stuff. But after
            fan reaction, it took about three shows to where we were playing 80% old stuff
            and 20% from the new record. And I understand that...I mean, if I go see some
            classic band, I want to hear the songs I grew up with. So I really understand
            that, and it wasn't really a problem.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>Did that influence your decision at any point to make you think
                    "Well, I like this new aggressive stuff, but the older stuff is <i>really</i>
                    cool...", that the old stuff was what you wanted to be playing?</b></span><br>
            It didn't influence my personal decision, because I really wanted to do the classic sound. I'd been a little
            more compromising [on <b><i>Reopening the Gates</i></b>]. My son was singing, he was a young kid, and he was
            into a lot more newer-sounding stuff. There was a little more of a compromise to try to
            write songs that everybody felt good with. I personally wanted to make the
            record as Omen as possible, and [playing the old stuff on the tour] just
            reinforced that for me. It was time to decide that I needed to find another
            singer. I mean, he's my son, and I love him, but he needed to go his way and I
            needed to do what I wanted to do. So I found Kevin (Goocher, vocals) and he's
            totally into the classic Omen sound, and that's what we're going after now.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>And Kevin can handle all the old stuff? Maybe not step into J.D.'s
                    shoes, exactly, but...</b></span><br>
            Before we even gave Kevin a permanent spot in the
            band, I brought him in and we didn't even work on new material. We worked up
            about 10 old songs and just played an unannounced local gig, because I didn't
            want someone that couldn't handle the old stuff. So before it was a permanent
            thing, we just brought him in and said, "OK, here's the old stuff, let's see if
            you can do that." And when he pulled that off, then I handed him some new
            music, basically writing the same way I always have, which is writing the music
            to the song and then letting the singer come in and finish it off. And he was
            stellar at that. I gave him four songs and asked him to come back the next
            night with one, and he came back the next night with all four of them! I think
            he's going to be perfect for the band.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>So is that the way you wrote songs on the early albums...you did the
                    music, and would you do the lyrics as well?</b></span><br>
            Well, on the very first Omen record, I wrote lyrics to
            a couple of the songs. A few of those songs were originally Savage Grace songs.
            But I'm not really that comfortable being the lyricist. I mean, I can do it,
            but it's just not my forte, and it's so stressful for me, because I don't want
            it to be stupid [laughs]. Like "Oh he's writing the lyrics? Well, those suck!"
            So with the traditional Omen, on the first three or four records, we would
            write the music and then I would hand the tapes over to J.D. (Kimball, vocals) and
            he'd come in with lyric ideas. I would always tweak `em, I always have an input
            on `em, but I prefer to work with somebody who's going to handle their end of
            that, as long as it's in the vein of what we're doing.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>Right, there was a medieval flavor to a lot of the lyrics.</b></span><br>
            Exactly. And I've usually got my hands full. I'm usually producing or co-producing, and on the last record
            and this one I'm full-on producing and engineering. So I don't really need to be trying to write
            lyrics <i>and</i> play guitar <i>and</i> produce <i>and</i> engineer. I had to
            do a lot of that on the last record, I had to write a lot of lyrics and stuff,
            and it didn't really turn out to be a very fun experience. It was a little bit
            too much of a load.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>I think it's often good for the singer to write lyrics, since he's going
                    to be carrying the vocal lines.</b></span><br>
            Right. You want him to do something that he's comfortable with.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>So you and Jody wrote most of the music for the first few Omen
                    albums?</b></span><br>
            Typically Jody wrote about one song per record. Well,
            actually I wrote almost all of <b><i>The Curse</i></b> at my mother's house. We
            had just come off tour and I went to my mother's house in Oklahoma and sat on
            the front porch with my red Charvel, unplugged, and wrote 95% of the music for <b><i>The
                    Curse</i></b>, with no amp. I just sat there and picked it out, then we went
            back to L.A. and we worked up the tunes, and then J.D. came in and we did the
            lyrics. That's generally how it worked: writing the music and then giving it to
            the singer.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>Is that the way you're handling
                    <i>Eternal Black Dawn</i>?</b></span><br>
            Actually, we had written probably over half of the
            stuff for this record musically before we hired Kevin. We were looking for a
            singer, so we just started writing music. We brought in two or three guys and
            looked at them, and Kevin definitely had the most traditional Omen sound. He
            really seemed to be into it, a hard worker. That's what I wanted to find,
            somebody who wanted to put out the same kind of effort that I was.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>So did you put out an ad or an open call for a vocalist, or did
                    you just go to a couple of clubs and say, "That guy would be good, let's steal
                    him."</b></span><br>
            Well, we didn't put out an open call at all, because I
            just didn't want to deal with all that. I've been around Dallas, and I've seen
            a couple of singers in bands around here over the years. We tried this other
            guy, Matt (Story). He had a great voice, but his work ethic wasn't really that
            heavy, and I really didn't want to get back into being the person that had to
            write the lyrics again. And we'd known Kevin forever; he'd been around in bands
            around Dallas. So Andy (Haas, bass) said, "You know, we really need to try
            Kevin." I didn't know, but we brought him over and I was blown away. I mean,
            he's not Geoff Tate, but his voice is great and he's into the traditional Omen
            sound. He's more of a Dio type of voice, with a little bit of J.D. thrown in
            there. I don't think anybody's going to be disappointed.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>You recorded a few tracks with Matt Story on vocals,
                    right?</b></span><br>
            Yeah, we did a couple of tracks for this Iron Maiden
            tribute thing, and Matt sang on one of those. Matt has a great voice and he's
            still a close friend, but his job was taking up so much of his time. It was
            going to be like it was on <b><i>Reopening</i></b> where I would have to try to
            write lyrics and melodies and stuff, and I just didn't want to go through that again.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>What Iron Maiden tune did you cover?</b></span><br>
            We did "Murders in the Rue Morgue," and Jason McMaster
            from Dangerous Toys sang on it. He's an old friend of mine; I've known him
            since the early Omen days. We see each other occasionally. Actually, we didn't
            even see each other for that. We recorded the music and sent it down to him in
            Austin, and he did the vocals and sent it back. But I see him from time to time
            when he comes through town, and we're old friends from the old L.A. days, we
            used to hang out together then.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>So this was after Watchtower, because they were from Texas, too.</b></span><br>
            Yeah, that was early Dangerous Toys, right around
            their first record probably. But Jason's a good friend of mine, so he sang
            "Murders." It was a low-budget, quickie thing, but it was fun, for sure.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>And you recorded a track called "War of the Gods" with Matt
                    Story on vocals. Was that a one-off thing that got released nowhere, or is that song going to be
                    released anywhere?</b></span><br> Actually, it ended up on that Maiden tribute. What happened was,
            everybody did a Maiden song and then an original. So that'll be the end with it; it was a one-off thing.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>Oh, I didn't know that song actually got put out.</b></span><br>
            Yeah, it was a two-CD set on a really small label. [Twilight Records 1999]
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>Well, there are so many Maiden tributes out now, it's hard to keep track!</b></span><br> Exactly!
            [laughs]
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>What was the title of the one you were on?</b></span><br>
            I think it was <b><i>Maiden America</i></b>. It was a
            fun thing, and it was kind of an interim there where we weren't really doing
            anything, so it kind of got us back writing again.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>So how did you get signed up to
                    do the project in the first place?</b></span><br>
            Actually, one of the bands that was on this label-and
            forgive me, but I don't remember what the name of the label is right now, it's
            been a year and a half-but one of the bands had done a couple of Omen songs on
            their first CD. I don't remember if we got in touch with them or if they got
            touch with us, but we started talking through that, and they said, "We're doing
            this Maiden thing. Do you guys want to do a tune on it?" And we said, "Sure!"

        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>I know that Sacred Steel did a cover of "Battle Cry."</b></span><br>
            Yeah, I think that's the band. I mean, don't hold me
            to that…it's been almost two years. I don't even know if I have a copy of the
            CD anymore. But it was flattering for sure; it was the first time I'd heard
            anybody cover an Omen song. It was cool. I had the CD at one time, but I don't
            know what happened to it. They didn't do a bad job on it.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>OK, so the new Omen lineup includes you and Kevin, and you've got
                    Andy Haas on bass, from back in the Step Child days.</b></span><br>
            I've been playing with Andy for over 10 years now. It
            doesn't seem like it; time flies by. He was the first person I hooked up with,
            and me and him formed Stepchild together. Yeah, I've been playing with him for
            about 11 years now.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>You did a couple of indie CDs as Step Child.</b></span><br>
            Yeah, we did actually, and we did real well. We did
            product of our own and sold it to distributors. Actually, for a point there, I
            was making more money than I did when I was in Omen. The stuff sold well, and
            we got some regional radio play. We were pretty much out on the road every
            week, four or five days a week.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>Did you keep it local when you played out?</b></span><br>
            Well, we kept it regional. We did Texas, Oklahoma,
            Kansas and Louisiana. I had a good time in that band. The music didn't really
            turn me on, but I had just come out of the big breakup of Omen. I was kind of
            depressed about the music business in general, and it was a fun band. I had a
            good time, but it got to the point where I was like, "Well, this is fun, but I
            really would like to go back to playing by myself." So I decided that we were
            going to spread ways and that I was going to put the Omen back together, and I
            never really thought about playing with anybody else but Andy. We've just been
            close friends for so long, stood by each other through thick and thin, and it
            never crossed my mind to use anybody else but him.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>Who's on drums for this record?</b></span><br>
            Rick Murray, the same guy that was on <b><i>Reopening the Gates</i></b>. Rick was a little reluctant about
            the old sound, but we pounded it into him! [laughs] We just kept making him play the old stuff over
            and over again, and I think he's playing a whole lot more like traditional Omen
            on this thing. Like I said, Rick and my son are younger and they're both into
            newer-sounding stuff, Pantera and stuff like that, and I probably compromised a
            lot more than I should have on the last record. But Rick has stayed through it,
            worked on his playing, and worked on playing more in the style of what we were
            doing before. I think the European tour helped a lot, when he saw how much
            people loved the old stuff. He's played really well, and he's cut some really
            good tracks on this record.

        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>So back in the beginning, how did you get into metal in the first place? You ended up moving from
                    Oklahoma to L.A.</b></span><br>
            I grew up in Oklahoma. My best friend was a bass player, and we'd work stuff up together. I don't know if we
            were quite full-on
            metal…we were maybe somewhere between Rush and Thin Lizzy and early Maiden, a
            little bit more technical kind of stuff. We worked up a pretty good following,
            and we'd written a ton of originals and opened for some big bands that came
            through. I was like, "I want more." And everybody else said they wanted more,
            but when it came time to move, I ended up being the only one. And Jody (Henry,
            original Omen bassist) had actually played in a cover band with my brother. So
            Jody actually went out to L.A. to be the rhythm guitarist, but I couldn't find
            a bass player that I was comfortable playing with. Basically, I don't really
            have a good time playing with a second guitar player, with the exception of my
            son, who played exactly like me. I mean, sometimes I couldn't tell whether it
            was me playing the part or him playing the part, and I'd have to really
            concentrate on which one of us was playing. But other than that, I think I have
            a little bit of a different, distinct picking style, and it's always been tough
            for me, it's always felt like a train wreck for me when I had a second guitar
            player that I couldn't really lock in tight with. So I couldn't really find a bass
            player, so I convinced Jody to play bass and went from there.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>And Steve (Wittig, original Omen drummer) had gone out to L.A. with you guys, too?</b></span><br>
            Yeah, Steve had been out there before and he went back
            out there with us. I had played off and on with Steve from my learning days in
            the cover bands in Oklahoma, five sets a night in the bars. I had played with
            Steve several times, and he'd gone to L.A. for a while. He came back to
            Oklahoma and said, "Man, you gotta go out there. All the bands play one-hour sets
            and it's all originals and you don't have to play covers." And when we got
            there and were trying to put something together, and Jody was going to be a
            rhythm guitar player and we were looking for a bass player and looking for a
            singer, and nothing was really clicking. There was a lot of straight-up rock
            stuff going on there, Poison-type stuff, and I couldn't really find players
            that I thought were technical enough or good enough to do what we really wanted
            to do. Then I got the invitation to join Savage Grace, so I did that. And while
            I was working on that stuff, Steve had hooked up with some band that J.D. was
            putting together, or they had been together for a while. They never really got
            out of the garage, and they had some really good tunes too, it was a shame.
            When I decided I was going to do my own thing, Steve told me he was playing
            with this band and to come and hear them. J.D. was singing and he was perfect
            for what we were doing, so we kind of stole him out of that band and went from
            there.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>You mentioned that you'd written some Omen tunes that were
                    actually performed by Savage Grace for a while...</b></span><br>
            Yeah, "Battle Cry" and "Die by the Blade" were both
            Savage Grace songs for a while. Then I was asked if we could drop those songs
            from the set, and that's when I decided it was time for me to move on. And it
            had been a struggle, because I had joined the band with the deal that I would
            play half of the leads and get three or four songs each record. And I kept
            writing songs and they kept getting turned down, and I kind of forced those two
            songs in. We started playing them out and they were really going over well, and
            so it got to where I needed to go back to what I originally started out to do.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>Well, Omen is a pretty different style from Savage Grace. When you
                    compare the <i>Master of Disguise</i> stuff to the <i>Battle Cry</i> stuff that
                    came out at the same time, it's a very different sound.</b></span><br>
            It is a different sound, and me and Chris (Logue,
            Savage Grace's guitarist) didn't really click as guitar players that well
            together. I'm a very staccato, Randy Rhoads kind of player, and he was kind of
            a Jimmy Page, "all over the place" kind of player. It just wasn't really fun
            for me.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>Did you have a hand in writing anything on <i>The Dominatress</i> EP?</b></span><br>
            That was all pretty much written when I got there. I
            think in "Fight for Your Life," I think I wrote the bridge for that song. They
            were about halfway through that song when I joined, and I think if you listen
            to the CD you can tell exactly the part I wrote, because it goes into a
            distinctly different style of picking and everything.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>Did you leave on bad terms? Did you still see those guys?</b></span><br>
            No no, I didn't consider it bad terms. Me and Brian
            East (Savage Grace's bass player) were good friends until I left L.A. I mean,
            it was time for me to move on, and I didn't hold anything against anybody and I
            hope they didn't hold anything against me. It just got to the point where I
            felt like I was being constricted and it was time for me to go do my thing.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>I'm glad it happened. We got Omen out of it, and Savage Grace put
                    out a couple of good ones. For the metal fan in me, it's the best thing that could've
                    happened.</b></span><br>
            Yeah, it was. I wanted to have my own band, but
            [joining Savage Grace] it was an opportunity that I couldn't turn down. And it
            turned out good for me, because I met Brian Slagel (owner of Metal Blade
            Records), and we hooked up and started hanging out. I told him about the two
            songs that I had, and that Savage Grace didn't want to play them anymore. He
            was like, "I love those songs. Why don't you put a band together?" So pretty
            much, we had a deal before we had a full band together. So, no, I have no hard
            feelings, I don't have any hard feelings toward anybody I've played with. And
            me and Brian East were friends for a long time. In fact, at a couple of Omen shows
            in L.A., he got up and played bass on "Battle Cry" a couple of times, and it
            was a blast.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>Do you know what those Savage Grace guys
                    are doing these days?</b></span><br>
            No, I haven't talked to anybody. I know that a couple
            of years ago some version of Savage Grace came through here, and I know Chris
            was in it. I stopped by and said hi to him. I had a gig myself that night. So I
            assume they're still doing something. I know Brian hasn't been in the band
            forever, and he was the one who asked me to join the band and we were always
            the tightest.
        </p>

        <p> <span class="interview_question">
                <b>So after Slagel told you to get a band together, you ended up on <i>Metal Massacre 5</i> with the
                    song "Torture Me."</b></span><br>
            We went and grabbed J.D. out of that garage band and
            wrote that song probably in one night's rehearsal, rehearsed it a couple of
            days and went in and recorded it. It was a pretty much a whirlwind from there
            into the whole <b><i>Battle Cry</i></b> thing. I think from the time we
            solidified the lineup to when we recorded was only about five weeks. I wish I
            could write like that with that enthusiasm and that whirlwind kind of thing
            again, but that probably happens once or twice in your lifetime...

            Exactly. I used to stay in the studio for days on end.
            Now I have a wife and kid to take care of, and everybody in the band has kids.
            You can't really put in the kind of time that I could back at that point in my

            Exactly right. We never demoed much of anything.

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>Did you get to do much touring after <i>Battle</i> <i>Cry</i> was
                    released? It sounds like everything happened very quickly.</b></span><br>
            We did a lot of short little shots. We went up the West coast two or three different times, and we came
            across as far as Texas a
            couple of times. We did some touring, but it wasn't anything hardcore. We'd
            shoot out for five or six days and nail some shows, and then whatever else we could latch onto we'd go out
            again. I think probably with <b><i>Warning of
                    Danger</i></b> we started doing a little more touring. We did some stuff with
            Metal Church, we did some stuff with Lizzy Borden. We were out with Motorhead a
            couple of times, for short jaunts, not for the whole tours but for a few dates.
            We played out a bit, not nearly as much as I would've liked to, but we played
            with some very cool guys, some very fun shows.

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>What are your favorite tunes off of <i>Battle Cry</i>?</b></span><br>
            Ahhhh, probably my three favorite songs off that record are "Battle Cry," "Die by the
            Blade," and "In the Arena." I love that song.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>Do you play those live now?</b></span><br>
            We play "Battle Cry" full on, and we play
            "Die by the Blade" as part of a medley of old stuff. We're going to stick it on the new
            record as a little treat, a bonus track for the old fans. It's got "Make Me Your
            King," "Dragon's Breath," "Die by the Blade," and a little bit of "Nightmares."
            It's so much fun to play; it's awesome to play it.

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>Was there any material left over after <i>Battle Cry</i>?</b></span><br>
            There was nothing, absolutely nothing.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>So you had to start from scratch for the second record, <i>Warning of Danger</i>?</b></span><br>
            Yeah, started from scratch. And it's a little bit more
            difficult to write every time, because you don't want to repeat yourself, and
            it's not the super adrenaline rush like it originally was. You know, I still think
            to this day, and I've always thought, that <b><i>Warning</i></b> was an
            underrated record. I thought it was a really good record, and I never really
            got that feeling from the label that the record was very successful. Then when
            we started cranking the band back up again, and we got to Europe and I started
            seeing all this stuff, "<b><i>Warning</i></b> is a great record" and charts of
            magazines saying "What are your all-time favorite metal records?" and <b><i>Warning
                    of Danger</i></b> would be right up there in the Top 10. It really reiterated what
            I thought. I just don't think the timing was right, and when that record came
            out, we didn't really get to tour that much for it. I think that record
            could've been and should've been a much bigger record for us than it was. And
            actually I listened to it when we started getting ready to go to Europe. I came
            home and I stuck it in because we had to figure out what songs we were going to
            play off of it. Stuck the cassette in the tape player, just to listen to it
            while I was going to sleep, and about halfway through it I jumped up and turned
            on the light. I was thinking, "Damn! This is a really good record!"
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>I completely agree that the album is underrated. Actually, in the last issue of HMF, each writer
                    turned in a review of five records we thoughtwere underrated, and I chose <i>Warning of Danger</i>
                    because it just never got out there as much as
                    I thought it should.</b></span><br> You know, I don't remember exactly what was going on at the
            time, but we just didn't really end up touring
            for it. I just don't remember there being that much push around it, and I kind of got the feeling
            that the record wasn't that well liked. And I knew at the time we were making
            it [that it was a good record]. It may not have had the energy of <b><i>Battle Cry</i></b>, but the playing
            was a lot tighter. We'd been playing together a
            while, and it wasn't quite so rushed, and I just thought it was a good record.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question">
                <b>I did too!</b></span><br> Now when I listen to it, it's easier for me to listen
            to <b><i>Warning</i></b> than to <b><i>Battle Cry</i></b>, because <b><i>Battle
                    Cry</i></b> was really rushed and it sounds sloppy to me, it doesn't sound
            really tight. I can sit down and listen to <b><i>Warning</i></b> a lot easier
            than <b><i>Battle Cry</i></b>.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>But <i>Battle Cry</i> has that classic sound, though. It sounds
                    exactly like it's supposed to sound.</b></span><br>
            Yeah, <b><i>Battle Cry</i></b> had that aura. And it
            didn't matter that it was recoded in four days, and it didn't matter that we'd
            only been playing together for four or five weeks. Like I said, there was just
            this energy to it, and an excitement that kind of overshadowed everything that
            was wrong with it. I know it's a lot of people's favorite record, and I'm
            certainly not gonna knock that. Those are great songs.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>And the deluxe gatefold vinyl LP is rather collectible in some
                    circles.</b></span><br> I think I still have two of the covers but I don't
            have the vinyl that goes in `em! [laughs] It's pretty bad that I can never seem
            to hang on to my own stuff. When we got ready to go to Europe, I had to go out
            and buy the CDs so I could sit down and relearn the songs.

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>That's harsh, though [laughs]...you could walk up to the record
                    counter and say, "This is my record. I'm on this!"</b></span><br>
            Actually, I didn't have <b><i>The Dominatress</i></b>
            either, the Savage Grace record. I saw it in a used record store and ended up
            having to pay $15 for it! The guy wanted $30 for it, so I was like, "Dude! I
            played on this record! Come on, cut me some slack, I don't have a copy of it

            and moved there, and I can guarantee that if you have a party at your house,
            your stuff tends to disappear! [laughs] I just can't seem to hang on to my own

                        Danger</i>?</b></span><br>
            I love "Hell's Gates." I'd love to do another song
            like that. I've tried to write another song in that vein two or three different
            times, but it's such a feeling thing. There's so much space in it, and you
            really have to get the feeling of it. I just think that was an excellent song.
            I love the title track too. Actually, John (J.D.) had written a song called
            "Warning of Danger" with the band he was with right before I got him, but the
            music wasn't really that good. He played me the tape, so I took his melodies
            and stuff and wrote new music to it, so that's what happened with that. I
            thought "Make Me Your King" was a cool song too.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>I thought everything on there was cool.</b></span><br>
            Yeah, I thought so. "Ruby Eyes" was a good song...it was just a good record.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>What was the reason for the
                    instrumental?</b></span><br>
            Well, I love doing instrumentals! If time
            permits, I'm going to do one on the new record. Sometimes I just like to get
            everything out of the way and stretch out and do some guitar playing, stack up
            some harmonies, get some cool different feelings in…I just love doing
            instrumentals.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>I'm not even going to ask what the song
                    title "V.B.P." stands for,
                    because I think I already know..."Vibrating Butt Plug"?</b></span><br>
            Yeah, it took people a long time to figure it out. We had a
            little contest after the record came out for somebody to
            guess what it meant. Girls would call me up every day and say, "Does it mean
            this? Does it mean that?" It took about three months before somebody finally
            got it. It had nothing to do with the song whatsoever; it was just some
            off-the-cuff remark.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>Just something funny and cryptic, huh?
                    You know that you've had
                    metal fans wondering for 16 years, saying "What the hell does V.B.P. stand for?"</b>
            </span><br>
            It was kind of like, "Well, what the hell are we
            going to call this song?" Then "I don't know...Vibrating Butt Plug!" [laughs] It
            was an off-the-cuff remark that just stuck, you know. S.R.B. [instrumental
            track on <b><i>The Curse</i></b>], on the other hand, did have a meaning behind
            it.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>That was about the Space Shuttle,
                    correct?</b></span><br>
            Correct. I dreamed that the thing blew up the night
            before it actually blew up.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>That's eerie.</b></span><br>
            Yeah, it was really eerie. We were on tour with Metal
            Church at the time, and we were down in south Texas. I think we played in San
            Antonio, and that night I dreamed that the Space Shuttle blew up. It wasn't the
            exact same scenario, but I dreamed that it blew up. And then we went on down to
            play Corpus Christi or someplace, and we were driving back out the next day
            when the news came on the radio, and I literally ran the truck of the road. I
            was driving the equipment truck at the time, and I just had to stop. It tripped
            me out really hard, so that song was kind of dedicated to that event.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>What do the initials actually stand for?</b></span><br> Shuttle Rocket
            Booster.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>So did you take your freaked-out
                    feelings afterward and write the
                    instrumental, or did you already have the tune and you just gave it the name?</b></span><br>
            No, I wrote the song afterwards.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>So the song was inspired by and then
                    dedicated to...</b></span><br>
            Correct. That's not something that's happened to me a
            bunch of times in my life, to have some sort of premonition like that. Forgive
            the pun! [laughs]
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>To me there's a pretty big jump, in terms of sonic quality and the
                    amount of time spent, between <i>Warning of Danger</i> and <i>The Curse</i>. <i>The Curse</i> is
                    really clean, and it feels like you were able to spend longer on the record.</b></span><br>
            Yeah, like I said, <b><i>Battle Cry</i></b> was a
            rushed record. <b><i>Warning of Danger</i></b> was probably about a two-week
            record, and that was mostly done on nights and weekends because everybody in
            the band was working then. For <b><i>The Curse</i></b>, I wasn't working, so I
            was able to totally concentrate on it. And we had a budget, what wouldn't
            really be considered by a major label as a "big" budget, but for us it was a
            windfall budget. It was three or four times what we'd had to work with before.
            We did everything on 48 tracks; we worked on it at Capitol Records and at a
            bunch of really nice studios. I could get up in the morning and get to the
            studio at 10 or 11 o'clock, play until 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, then go
            home and sleep. It wasn't like having to play (only) at night, and a lot more
            time was spent on it. As far as quality of the recording, <b><i>The Curse</i></b>
            is by far my favorite record. I mean, we spent more money for the drums on <b><i>The
                    Curse</i></b> than we did on the whole <b><i>Reopening the Gates</i></b>
            record!
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>Wow, that kind of puts it all in perspective.</b></span><br>
            It was just a lot of fun for me, because I'd always
            been pinched [with budgets]…we'd done stuff on 24 tracks, we'd done it in a
            hurry. There were a lot of guitar things, ideas and stuff, and vocal harmony
            ideas that I wanted to work on that we just didn't have the time or tracks for.
            It [recording <b><i>The</i></b> <b><i>Curse</i></b>] was a very enjoyable
            experience for me.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>And I'm sure it's more satisfying when you can hear something on
                    tape that sounds like what you hear in your head.</b></span><br>
            Exactly! And that record got the closest to what I was
            hearing in my head, that one out of anything we had done. I think if we could
            have had that kind of time and money to work with on <b><i>Battle</i></b> <b><i>Cry</i></b>,
            there's just no telling how great a record it would have been.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>Well, I still believe that it sounds exactly like it's supposed to
                    sound...</b></span><br>
            Yeah, to <i>you</i>, because that's the way you've
            always heard it. But to <i>me</i>, there was all this stuff that was like, "Oh,
            that's sloppy, but we don't have time to mess with it..."
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>Do you feel the temptation sometimes to tweak those tunes a little
                    bit? Say you're playing "Battle Cry" in the live set now, do you feel tempted
                    to add in some of those little parts or ideas?</b></span><br>
            You know, I'm a big improvising live player and seldom
            will ever play a song the same way twice. Not to say that I don't pay homage to
            what it's supposed to be, but I'm always slipping little stuff in and out or
            changing something a little. I'm more of an inspired player live. You're not
            going to come to an Omen show and just hear the record. You're gonna hear the
            songs, but...[they might sound a little different] but you're not gonna be like
            "Hey what the hell is that part doing there?" Live, I'm much more of an
            improviser, so if I'm really into it that night, I might slip some extra licks
            in.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>Oh, I love that, when a band kind of gives a song new life. It's
                    much more interesting.</b></span><br>
            Right. If I want to hear the song perfectly, I'll put
            in the CD. Especially since most of the time I've been in a one-guitar-player band,
            and in the recording process I like to stack some guitars up. It's sometimes
            hard to duplicate that live, so maybe you play something that's a little bit
            different, that adds something to the song. I love playing live; I love to
            improvise. You know, most of my straight-out, non-multitracked solos on all the
            records were one- or two-take things that I did off the cuff. I'll sit down and
            rehearse my rhythm tracks and rehearse the harmony parts I want to do, but I
            never, ever rehearse a lead solo. Just play the tape a couple of times, let me
            warm up to it, then hit the record button and see what comes out.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>That's almost a live feeling to the whole lead section.</b></span><br>
            Exactly.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>Speaking of live recordings, you put the one live track on the
                    <i>Nightmares</i> EP. It was the AC/DC cover.</b></span><br>
            Yeah, but that was "studio live," it wasn't live."
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>That's what I was going to ask: Are there any live Omen recordings from
                    that era?</b></span><br>
            No. There was one live recording from when we had
            Coburn [Pharr, vocals] in the band, and the quality of it really sucked. I was
            afraid it was going to get out, so I destroyed the tapes so it could never get
            out. There was a radio station that was really big down in the Southwest,
            Z-Rock, and we did a live concert with them and the tape from that sounded
            really good. Nobody ever really ended up putting it out. I think Metal Blade
            talked about it at one time, but it was a good recording and it was a good
            energetic show.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>So this was during the J.D. era or the
                    Coburn era?</b></span><br>
            This was during the Coburn era. There's no live stuff with
            J.D., unfortunately. I wish there was.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>So what was the reason for the EP? Was
                    that toward the end of J.D.
                    and Steve's tenure with the band, and it just worked out to be an EP?</b></span><br>
            Actually, the reason for the EP was that we didn't get
            to tour like we had wanted for <b><i>The</i></b> <b><i>Curse</i></b>. There was
            some tour stuff coming up and <b><i>The</i></b> <b><i>Curse</i></b> had been
            out for over a year, so we wanted to have some new material out. That thing was
            done in about two days...we went into the studio, cut all the stuff in pretty much
            one take, slapped some vocals on there, and mixed it. I'll tell you what we
            spent on that EP: $2,500 in recording costs.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>What?! You've got to be kidding me!</b></span><br>Nope.</p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>That's got to be some sort of record for
                    the quickest recording!</b></span><br>
            Well, we did it because we had waited to get some
            stuff to tour for behind <b><i>The</i></b> <b><i>Curse</i></b>, and we weren't
            [doing any touring]. And then we got some tour stuff, and <b><i>The</i></b> <b><i>Curse</i></b>
            was really old. We thought, "We probably need something new to be selling out
            here." So we just threw that thing out. At that point, there were no plans to
            change any members. Actually, the touring that we were doing after the EP came
            out was unfortunately where the member changes started coming in.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>Why exactly did those guys [J.D. and
                    Steve] end up leaving?</b></span><br>
            Well...the thing is, I love J.D.'s singing. Like I said,
            when we started putting this thing back together, I looked to see if J.D. was
            still around. But at that point in time, we'd worked really, really hard, and
            we were landing some bigger tours, got some good reviews and stuff. And he just
            couldn't keep his shit together. I'd worked so hard for so long...it was a hard
            decision. We were playing a pretty big show with Saxon, Killer Dwarves and
            Fates Warning, and [things just fell apart. I'd rather not get into it too
            much. He had some personal problems.] Actually, Coburn finished the tour that
            J.D. started. I'd been renting a house together with him, and he was a singer
            in some band in L.A. [After things fell apart with J.D.], there were about 20
            dates left on the tour, but we had about a week before the next show. I didn't
            know what the hell I was going to do. I called back to the house in L.A., and
            Coburn just said, "Dude, I can learn those songs." So he ended up finishing
            about 90% of that tour, and that's how he ended up in the band.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>That's cool, like it's all about who you
                    know...</b></span><br>
            Yeah, exactly. We were roommates, and he had all the
            records. He got on a plane and flew out, and we rehearsed for about two days, I
            think. He was listening to the damn albums on the plane! So we just continued
            the tour, and it actually turned out to be fairly successful, one of our better
            tours. And it could have been a great tour if John could've kept his stuff
            together. I hope he has [gotten himself together]. And like I said, if the
            timing had been right when we started this Omen thing back up, I would have
            loved to play with him again. </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>And I would love to have heard that! He had a very different voice.</b></span><br>
            Yeah he did, he had a unique voice, and we wrote well
            together. I wouldn't put anything against working with him again in the future.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>What about Steve? He recorded <i>Escape to Nowhere</i>, but then he split after that.</b></span><br>
            Steve's a great drummer. I've still talked to him from
            time to time over the years. But he was at the point in his life where he was wanting
            to settle down and have kids and stuff. He wasn't really putting the effort
            into it that probably needed to be put into it. We didn't leave on hard
            feelings at all. It's probably been a couple of years, but I still talk to him
            every once in a while.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>Yeah, he was a phenomenal drummer.</b></span><br>
            Great drummer. Steve always played a song the very
            best the first time he heard it. You'd come in with a song idea, and he'd play
            it like he knew it. And to get him to play it the same way in the studio might
            be a little bit harder! [laughs] He was kind of like me; he'd grown up playing
            in cover bands and stuff, and he could play off the cuff. You couldn't really
            stump him. Like I said, I have nothing against any of those guys I played with.
        </p>


        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>So Cam Daigneault stepped in to take
                    Steve's place on drums, but he didn't record with you guys, did he?</b></span><br>
            Cam never recorded, but we did the biggest tour in the
            history of Omen after the <b><i>Escape to Nowhere</i></b> record. We did all of
            the U.S. and Canada, and we were out on the road for about two months. But it
            didn't really feel like Omen to me any more, so I thought it was maybe time to
            put it to bed.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>That record was a big change for you
                    guys, just in terms of song style,
                    cover art, etc. You worked with Paul O'Neill and the artist who did a bunch of
                    Savatage covers.</b></span><br>
            Correct. Paul is a great guy, and I loved working with
            him, but he probably wasn't the guy that we should've had at that point in
            time. We'd really written a completely different record with a completely
            different title. We were just going to go back and do another record with Bill
            [Metoyer]. Then we got a chance to go out to New York to work
            with Paul, and we thought maybe it's time for a change of pace. Then pretty
            much every song off the record got scrapped, and I think Coburn takes a lot of
            blame from people thinking that he changed our style, but that wasn't really
            the case. I wish we had gone ahead and recorded the record that we had written,
            I don't think it would have been that big of a change from what we'd been
            doing. Coburn definitely had a different type of voice, but we weren't really
            wanting to change the music that drastically at all.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>So the original record was going to be <i>Era of Crisis</i>?</b></span><br> Right.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>But none of that material made it onto the actual record?</b></span><br>
            The song "Escape to Nowhere" was the only one
            that was original and left over from those writing sessions.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>Do you have the other tracks someplace?</b></span><br>
            Don't have those tracks, don't have the tapes, nothing...
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>Don't have them in your head anymore?</b></span><br>
            Don't have them in my head. I mean, we got out to New
            York and spent a year completely rewriting the songs. That's the first record
            that I ever wrote a ton of songs for. We kept rewriting and rewriting, trying
            to get stuff that the producer and we agreed on. It wasn't the most pleasant
            experience I've ever had. But I learned a lot, don't get me wrong. I definitely
            have nothing against Paul O'Neill. He just wasn't really familiar with the
            history of Omen or our sound. And we were ready to take some direction. I
            hadn't really taken much direction on the first three records. I'd pretty much
            produced and written everything, and co-produced with Bill, but I thought we
            weren't where we needed so be so maybe I should listen to somebody else. And I
            wish I hadn't...we would've been best off just to stay in LA and record the
            record with the songs we had written.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>Paul does great work with Savatage and Trans-Siberian Orchestra
                    and those kinds of things, but that's not the same style.</b></span><br>
            The man is a musical genius. I love the TSO stuff, and
            I love the Savatage stuff. But that wasn't Omen, and we should've stuck with
            what we did best.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="interview_question"><b>You mentioned at one point that there were some underground
                    bootleg tapes of that old, scrapped material.</b></span><br>
            Somebody told me in Europe that somebody had a
            cassette of it, which just blows me away, because we never even demoed the
            stuff except for sticking a jambox in the rehearsal room and recording the
            stuff live. I'd love to find a tape of that, because there are probably some
            cool songs that would be good to play again. But by the time the <b><i>Escape
                    to Nowhere</i></b> record was finished, those songs were so lost, just gone...
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>I actually saw a German web site that
                    had the Omen discography and
                    it included the <i>Era of Crisis</i> record.</b></span><br>
            That was the title for the record, and it was a
            completely different-sounding record than what ended up coming out. The odd
            thing is that the song "Thorn in Your Flesh" was a radio hit. We actually had
            these big crowds of people that we hadn't had before and they'd heard the song
            on the radio. We're selling out these shows and everybody is singing "Thorn in
            Your Flesh." The tour and the initial success of the record were great. But
            then the radio song wore off, and the core following wasn't there anymore.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>So after that, you decided that it wasn't where you wanted the
                    band to go? Was there ever any hope of reverting back to make the record that
                    really should have followed <i>The Curse</i>?</b></span><br>
            We thought about it, and me and Coburn talked and he
            wanted to still keep trying to do something. But it was...well, Jody had gone off
            with some girl he had met in northern California and had left. Cam was a great
            guy, but he couldn't really play the traditional Omen style. I just thought,
            "Y'know, I'm the only original member left, and let's just put this thing to
            bed."
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>But now it's back, so that's good.</b>
            </span><br> Yeah, it took me a while, and I'm still the only
            original member left. But at least some time has passed.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>I think it's interesting that your big
                    attempt to "make it big" was <i>Escape to Nowhere</i>, but that's the only one left that Metal Blade
                    hasn't reissued. It's out of print, right?</b></span><br>
            Yes, that's the only one that's not available. The
            other ones have been reissued two or three times. I still see checks off all
            the other stuff. The thing was, we had an audience for that record that wasn't
            really our core audience. It sold well, and we toured and played to more people
            than we'd played for in our whole career because we had a song on the radio.
            But once the song went off the radio, the old core audience kind of said, "What
            the hell are you guys doing?" Which was what I said when we finished the
            record, "What the hell are we doing?"
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>So "Thorn in Your Flesh," your radio hit, is the only track
                    from that album that made it onto the "best of" compilation <i>Teeth of the Hydra</i>.</b></span><br>
            There was this chain of radio stations, and the song stayed
            in the Top 20 for five or six months. It was getting played five or six times a
            day.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>That's got to feel nice.</b></span><br>
            Yeah, it felt great, but in retrospect, I wish we had just finished the original record we had.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>Me too, I would love to have heard it. So from <i>The Curse</i>,
                    what were your favorite tracks?</b></span><br>
            Well, "Teeth of the Hydra" is my all-time favorite
            Omen song. It's not the most technical, but it just has a good groove and it's
            just fun to play. That's my all-time favorite song to play or to listen back to
            now. And the instrumental, I had a great time with that. The song "The Curse"
            was pretty cool, although it didn't really turn out exactly like I had it in my
            head. Sometimes that just happens. It didn't quite have the balls that I wanted
            it to have.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>How about off of <i>Escape to
            Nowhere</i>, anything that stands out for you?</b></span><br>
            There's a couple of songs on there that I kind of
            like
            the music to, but the production and the way the guitars sound...
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>It's a very flat record, after
                    the brightness of <i>The Curse</i>.</b></span><br>
            Yeah, very flat. I was pretty much forced not to
            play
            my own guitars and not to play my own amps. It just wasn't fun.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>Did you guys decide to do the
                    cover of "Radar Love," or was that
                    an idea that was brought to you?</b></span><br>
            That was an idea that was brought to us. I don't
            have
            anything against that song, but if it would just have been me doing a cover, it
            would have been a Thin Lizzy song or something like that.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>Like what?</b></span><br>
            Like "Emerald" or "Thunder and
            Lightning." My all-time
            favorite band is Thin Lizzy. I just got to see the tribute thing that John
            Sykes and Scott Gorham did. When I first saw that they were coming through, I
            was pissed, because it was like you can't possibly play Thin Lizzy without Phil
            Lynott. But at the last minute, I decided to go, and it was, quite frankly, the
            best show I've seen in 10 years. It wasn't perfect, but John Sykes sang the
            songs and you didn't think, "Man, you're fucking up that song." And the guitar
            playing between him and Scott Gorham was just awesome, all the harmonies…The
            only thing wrong with the show was that it only lasted about 50 minutes. I was
            like, "Come on, play more stuff!"
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>Headlining for 50 minutes?!</b>
            </span><br>
            They were just headlining small clubs, and they did
            a
            small club in downtown Dallas. It packed out for sure, but there was no advertising
            or anything for it. If I hadn't seen on the web site, just been screwing around
            one day and typed in "Thin Lizzy," I wouldn't have even known it was coming
            through. If I'm going to cover a song, it'll probably be a Thin Lizzy song.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>What's your favorite Thin Lizzy
                    album? Hard to pick, I know...</b></span><br>
            Yeah, hard to pick. <b><i>Jailbreak</i></b>, maybe,
            because I love "Emerald." Actually, we were going to do "Emerald" around the
            <b><i>Warning
                    of Danger</i></b> / <b><i>The Curse</i></b> time, but John didn't like Thin
            Lizzy, and he didn't want to sing the song. A million times I've been wanting
            to do that song...When it was suggested for <b><i>Escape to Nowhere</i></b> that
            we do a cover, I was like, 'Let's do a Thin Lizzy song." But they were like,
            "Ahhh, nobody knows who they are." Well I don't really give a shit, you know?
            I've never been a big "try to please the masses" kind of person.

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>What would be your top five
                    albums of all time? Stuff that
                    inspires you in some way or still sounds amazing and fresh?</b></span><br>
            This is a weird thing, because it's always
            "Black Sabbath
            with Ozzy," but <b><i>Heaven and Hell</i></b> [with Dio] is still one of my top
            five all-time records. To me, it's kind of like a <b><i>Battle Cry</i></b>
            where there was just an energy on it, and it was just fresh. And <b><i>Jailbreak</i></b>.
            It gets harder after that…Some of the classic early Maiden stuff, before they
            got too locked in to every song sounding the same. They kind of got in rut
            there, but some of the early stuff was really cool, musical stuff.

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>What do you think about
                    <i>Brave</i> <i>New</i> <i>World</i>?</b></span><br>
            Other than the song they play on the radio, I
            haven't
            even listened to it. I don't listen to very much music right now, and
            especially when I'm writing I try not to listen to any music. Inadvertently
            something could get stuck in your head and you'd copy something. So especially
            during the writing process, I try not to listen to hardly any music.

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>Nothing? Not classical or
                    anything...</b></span><br>
            I'll listen to some classical stuff, but anything
            that's in the vein of what we're doing, I try to steer as far clear of it as I
            can. When it comes time to mix, I might grab some records that I think sound
            good, and listen to them. But in the writing process, maybe subconsciously, you
            could end up copying something and you don't even know it until somebody might
            point out, "Hey, that lick is the same as that lick." Then it's like, "Ooooooh,
            shit," because I'm really hardcore about not trying to rip off somebody else's
            idea.

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>Well, Omen has a very particular

            I used to get it a lot at first that "Ohhh,
            Omen is
            just a Maiden rip off." Well, if I was ripping off anything as far as the
            harmony guitars and the single-note riffs, it was Thin Lizzy, not really
            Maiden. Not to say that I didn't love Maiden and listen to them, so there might

            We're going to do that, and then it depends on when
            we
            finish the record. I was hoping to have the record finished by May or June.
            It's just so hard with everybody's schedules-everybody works, everybody has a
            family, and to really work as much as we need to on it...well, I've made up my
            mind on one thing, after we really got super-rushed on the last record. If it's
            done and it sounds good in June, then it's gonna come out. If it doesn't and we
            have to work on it until next fall, then [we will]. Basically we just get to
            work on the thing two or three nights a week, but I'm not going to be pushed to
            finish it. That's why we haven't really played any of the stuff to any labels
            yet, because I don't want anybody to say, "OK, it's got to be out now." So
            we're going to take our time, hopefully have it done this summer, then start
            trying to line up who we're going to get to put the thing out, and see what
            playing we're going to do. It's not going to be the year-long tour, I can tell
            you that, because everybody's got responsibilities. We'll probably try to do
            little spurts of five or six days, and try to pick the shows that will help us
            the most. Granted, if the record takes off and it financially becomes viable,
            we'll stop working and tour. On the other hand, my kid has still got to eat
            [laughs]. So we'll try to pick our spots and try to play cool stuff like the
            Classic Metal Festival and try to latch on to some more stuff. I definitely
            want to try to go to Europe; we probably can't go for a month again, but maybe
            we can go for two weeks.

            that <b><i>The

            tripping me out, like "whoah!" It was ahead of Maiden and Kiss records. I'd
            love to go to Japan. It's a matter of who distributes the record and what ties
            they have over there. We're definitely going to try to play the festivals and
            stuff like that, where we can go out and not have to be gone for a real long
            time. And we'll see where it goes. If it takes off, we'll definitely be out

                    come up with something that is a lot more traditional?</b></span><br>
            You know what pressure I feel-and this is the same
            pressure that I've felt since we did <b><i>The Curse</i></b>-I feel pressure
            from me to put out a record that I like. And it's been quite a while. If I put
            a record out and I like it and everybody else hates it, then so be it. But it's
            hard to defend something when you don't really like it that much yourself, you
            know? That's the biggest pressure I feel on myself, not getting influenced by
            outside sources, and to just do a record that I like and that I think is a cool
            record. Is it going to sound as good as <b><i>The Curse</i></b>? Probably not,
            because we don't have that kind of money to work with anymore. But hopefully
            it's going to sound better than anything we've done since <b><i>The Curse</i></b>.

                    hard decision, trying to whittle down three albums worth of stuff?</b></span><br>
            Well, it depends on how much time we have. If we have
            enough time, I'll play for two hours. That was the hard thing in Europe. We had
            about a 45- to 50-minute set and it's hard to figure out, you know? We tried to
            do two or three songs of each record, at least for the first three records. I'd
            like to expand that. So when we do the Classic Metal Festival, it'll probably
            be two or three songs off the new record and the rest off the first three
            records.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>And you're certainly going to

            Certainly will play "Teeth of the Hydra,"
            "Battle
            Cry," Termination"…We'll try to get a couple more old things in there. I enjoy
            it, those songs are a lot more fun for me to play than any of the stuff after
            that. They're more my style, more comfortable, and there's a lot more energy to
            them. When we tour, regardless of how successful this record, it'll be an equal
            part of that [new material] and the first three records. Probably the other
            stuff is not going to have much space in the set.

            character. [laughs] The classic Omen show to me was...well, we didn't have much
            of a stage show. We had the big snake backdrop and some ramps. It was
            energetic, a lot of moving around, a lot of energy, and not a big focus on
            anything away from the music.

            It would be difficult. Not impossible, but it would
            be
            difficult. For songs like that, you've got to have your sound and your monitors
            and everything has got to be cool, and 90% of the time, especially when you're
            not headlining, you're out there with no sound check and you'd better keep it
            pretty basic. That's a song I've always wanted to play live, and maybe we will
            sometime. The chance would've come when I was playing with my son, when he was
            playing guitar, but that whole process was really hurried and we had more old
            stuff worked up than we could play in the set we had.

            Yeah, he has his own band. I don't really know what
            they're doing. I talk to him every week or two, but they're not really doing
            anything super. They had worked pretty hard on trying to get something out for
            a while, but I think they just couldn't seem to get it finished. It's a lot
            easier to talk about it than it is to actually get it done, unless you have
            somebody standing over you to whip you through it. I had a great time playing
            with him [in Omen]. The record and what we sounded like live were two totally
            different things. He really sang the old stuff well, and it enabled me to do a
            lot of the guitar parts that I normally couldn't do. It was incredibly
            enjoyable to play guitar with him. Maybe someday he can come back in and just
            play guitar and not sing; that pretty much depends on him. But that's the only
            time in my life that I've enjoyed having another guitar player in the band.

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>But how many bands have you been
                    in with another guitar player, besides Savage Grace?</b></span><br>
            The original Omen had two guitar players for about
            two weeks. In fact, I think it ended when we did "Torture Me" because we got
            into the studio and the guy couldn't really handle his parts, so I ended up
            playing all of his parts. He and John were good friends, and John wanted to
            bring him along into the band, but it was just really dragging us down.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>This was Joe Jaimes?</b></span><br>
            Yeah. After our first time in the studio, I just said,
            "John, I know the guy's your friend and everything..." I'm not going to babysit
            another guitar player. I don't have enough time to devote to what I want to do,
            without trying to babysit somebody else through it. So I played there, I played
            in Savage Grace, and some of the bands I played with in Oklahoma had two guitar
            players. It's just never been that fun for me, which is bad, because there's a
            lot of things that I'd like to do that require two guitar players. But for the
            10 or 15 seconds in the song that I'd like to have two guitar players, the hell
            of the other three minutes isn't worth it! [laughs]

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>Did you at any point consider not using the name Omen for the new
                    stuff? Because <i>Reopening the Gates</i> was really different, did you think
                    maybe you should use a new name, and maybe say, "With Kenny Powell of Omen."</b>
            </span><br>
            I thought about that a little bit on that record,and
            even after we finished it and started thinking about doing another one, if we
            were going to keep the same lineup. I don't know, that's really a tough
            decision. There are two Omen records there that probably shouldn't have been
            called Omen, but I don't think that's going to be the case with this one. I
            mean, did Maiden think about not being Maiden when they got rid of Bruce
            Dickinson? Probably not. I mean, it crossed my mind, but I think we're just
            getting back on track by making it Omen again.
        </p>

        <p><span class="interview_question"><b>That's all I have, Kenny. Do you
                    have any last words, or a message
                    for all the metalheads out there in Japan?</b></span><br>
            Just hang on and wait for this record to come out! I
            don't think anybody's going to be disappointed. I'll be really surprised if
            they are, because this is going to be the closest thing to Omen since <b><i>The
                    Curse</i></b>.
