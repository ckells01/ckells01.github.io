            Interview with Omen
        </h2>

        <p><b>April 2001</b></p>

        <p>When I heard that Omen had reformed in 1996, I was absolutely delighted. The band’s first three records, released back in the
        early and mid-80s, are certified metal classics, and <b><i>Warning of Danger</i></b> is
        truly one of my favorite records. But the album produced by the 90s version of
        Omen was ultimately disappointing, with a modern sound that strayed from the
        epic, melodic metal that the band offered on albums like <b><i>The Curse</i></b>.
        I was relieved to learn that Omen guitarist Kenny Powell was unhappy with the
        &quot;new Omen” and that he wanted to get back to the classic metal sound of the 80s albums.
        Now, armed with a new singer and a burning commitment to old school Omen metal,
        the band is back to what they do best: creating brilliant epic metal for the legions
        of Omen fans worldwide. Kenny took some time from his busy recording schedule
        to talk to me about the band’s history, their return to metal glory on their forthcoming record, and the
        bright future that is ahead for these metal warriors. Read on to learn just about anything you ever
        wanted to know about Omen!<br>Into the arena...</p>

        <p><b>You’re recording your new album now, right? How’s that going?</b><br>
        Yes, we’re in the middle of recording <b><i>Eternal Black Dawn </i></b>right now. Let’s see, as we speak, drum tracks are fairly
        well finished, bass tracks are finished, and I’m working on rhythm guitars. I’m trying to get back to doing something that I can really be proud of and
        something that’s a little bit more original Omen.</p>

        <p>
            <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2" color="#0060CC"><b>Back to the old school?</b></font><br>
            <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2">Yeah, back to the old school, because the old school
                was pretty damn fun, you know? It’s pretty easy sometimes to get
                caught up in trying to be cool or trying to be &quot;now,&quot; and sometimes you just
                have to do what you do best. You’re better off, and I haven’t done what I do
                best, really, since <b><i>The Curse</i></b>, as far as I’m concerned.</font>
        </p>

        <p>
            <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2" color="#0060CC"><b>I can see that. That record was the
                    pinnacle probably...</b></font><br>
            <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2">It was for me, because we had a nice budget, we did
                most of the record at Capitol Records, we had 48 tracks. I wasn’t really
                rushed, and I could sit down and really work on my guitar playing and the
                songwriting. That was probably the pinnacle record for me, for sure.</font>
        </p>

        <p>
            <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2" color="#0060CC"><b>The record sounded great. You and Bill
                    Metoyer worked on
                    that one together.</b></font><br>
            <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2">Me and Bill were bros, and we may try to bring Bill
                out to mix this new one. It depends on finances and time constraints. We’ve
                talked a couple of times, and if the point comes where we’re ready to mix and
                he’s not in the middle of something, we’re going to fly him out and try to mix
                this thing together. I’d really love to work with him again.</font>
        </p>

        <p>
            <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2" color="#0060CC"><b>So you guys are doing the record in your
                    own studio. That’s a
                    pretty nice luxury to have at this point in your career.</b></font><br>
            <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2">It is a luxury, and it’s taken several years to evolve
                it to the point where it’s starting to turn into a pretty cool little studio.
                After this record is done, I’m probably going to start recording some other
                bands.</font>
        </p>

        <p>
            <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2" color="#0060CC"><b>Would you produce them yourself?</b>
            </font><br>
            <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2">Yeah! I love producing. Sometimes I think I love
                producing more than playing; it’s a whole different thing. I’m a lot more
                relaxed as a producer, sitting there and being objective to the whole overall
                thing. When I’m just playing, I’m a lot more hyper and I’m not as objective.
                There’s probably a point at some time where I might get heavily into producing,
                but I still want to play for a few more years. We’ve been writing the cool
                stuff that’s…well, I’m not going to say it’s going to sound <i>exactly</i> like
                <b><i>Battle Cry</i></b>, but it’s more technical and it’s more musical and
                more of that same theme. Might have a little more crunch to it, might be a
                little crisper, but I think the old fans are really going to like this thing.
            </font>
        </p>

        <p>
            <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2" color="#0060CC"><b>Great! More of the old style!</b></font>
            <br>
            <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2">Yeah, more of the old style, not letting anybody else
                telling me what to play, and just playing. I guess I’m a little more of a dick
                on this record! [laughs] Because I tried to compromise for two or three
                records, and I can look back on it, the last 10 years or whatever that I
                played, and I’m like, &quot;Y’know, when I was a lot more headstrong…&quot; I’m proud of
                those older records, and I didn’t really know if anybody else really cared about
                the damn things, you know? And I’ve started to see lately that there are people
                out there who are like, &quot;I grew up on this&quot; or &quot;I still listen to it everyday,&quot;
                and it’s like, &quot;Whoah!&quot; It kind of reinforced my thoughts of what kind of music
                I should be playing.</font>
        </p>

        <p>
            <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2" color="#0060CC"><b>Why do you think that old the old Omen
                    stuff is so enduring?
                    Because those are classic records in a lot of circles, particularly Europe...</b></font><br>
            <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2">Oh yeah, Europe…I was shocked, because I didn’t know.
                We never played Europe when the classic Omen lineup was together. We were
                supposed to go two or three times, and little piddly shit knocked us out at the
                last minute. So I really had no clue until we went over in `97 with the <b><i>Reopening
                        the Gates</i></b> record, and all of a sudden every night at the bus there are
                50 or 60 kids with everything from demo tapes of stuff that I forgot I ever
                wrote to every record. And young kids, 18- and 19-year-old kids were like &quot;Omen
                rules!&quot; And I thought, &quot;Wow, I didn’t waste all those long nights in the
                studio, writing songs and eating Top Ramen. Somebody actually did care.&quot;</font>
        </p>

        <p>
            <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2" color="#0060CC"><b>Have you got a record label lined up to
                    release <i>Eternal Black
                        Dawn</i>?</b></font><br>
            <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2">We’re not quite sure what we’re going to do yet. We’re
                going to finish it on our own, and then go for the best deal. It’s not going to
                be a problem getting a deal. There’s a couple of things that we could
                definitely do right now, but last time we didn’t really get the record out in
                the U.S., it was a European-only thing. We’ve talked to Metal Blade a little
                bit; there may be a possibility of going back there. Whatever we do, I want to
                make sure there’s distribution in the U.S. and in Europe.</font>

                            support of <i>Reopening the Gates</i>.
                            That was when you were on Massacre Records.</b></font><br>
                    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2">Yeah, we went with Fates Warning. I think we did
                        about
                        23 shows. It was a cool tour, and we had a great time. It was great to get over
                        to Europe and see all the kids, all the young kids who had Omen records. It
                        tripped me out! Like I said, we were supposed to go twice in the 80s, but
                        little technical things knocked us out, so it was a long time coming. I wish I
                        could’ve gotten there a lot sooner.</font>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2" color="#0060CC"><b>Did you have a tough time
                            deciding what to play when you were over
                            there? I know you wanted to promote the new record, but the old stuff...</b></font><br>
                    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2">Well, we started out playing about half of the new
                        record, <b><i>Reopening the Gates</i></b>, and about half old stuff. But after
                        fan reaction, it took about three shows to where we were playing 80% old stuff
                        and 20% from the new record. And I understand that...I mean, if I go see some
                        classic band, I want to hear the songs I grew up with. So I really understand
                        that, and it wasn’t really a problem.</font>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2" color="#0060CC"><b>Did that influence your decision
                            at any point to make you think
                            &quot;Well, I like this new aggressive stuff, but the older stuff is <i>really</i>
                            cool...&quot;, that the old stuff was what you wanted to be playing?</b></font><br>
                    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2">It didn’t influence my personal decision, because I
                        really wanted to do the classic sound. I’d been a little more compromising [on <b><i>Reopening
                                the Gates</i></b>]. My son was singing, he was a young kid, and he was into a lot
                        more newer-sounding stuff. There was a little more of a compromise to try to
                        write songs that everybody felt good with. I personally wanted to make the
                        record as Omen as possible, and [playing the old stuff on the tour] just
                        reinforced that for me. It was time to decide that I needed to find another
                        singer. I mean, he’s my son, and I love him, but he needed to go his way and I
                        needed to do what I wanted to do. So I found Kevin (Goocher, vocals) and he’s
                        totally into the classic Omen sound, and that’s what we’re going after now.</font>

                    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2" color="#0060CC">
                        <p><b>And Kevin can handle all the old stuff? Maybe not step into J.D.’s
                                shoes, exactly, but...</b>
                    </font><br>
                    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2">Before we even gave Kevin a permanent spot in the
                        band, I brought him in and we didn’t even work on new material. We worked up
                        about 10 old songs and just played an unannounced local gig, because I didn’t
                        want someone that couldn’t handle the old stuff. So before it was a permanent
                        thing, we just brought him in and said, &quot;OK, here’s the old stuff, let’s see if
                        you can do that.&quot; And when he pulled that off, then I handed him some new
                        music, basically writing the same way I always have, which is writing the music
                        to the song and then letting the singer come in and finish it off. And he was
                        stellar at that. I gave him four songs and asked him to come back the next
                        night with one, and he came back the next night with all four of them! I think
                        he’s going to be perfect for the band.</font>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2" color="#0060CC"><b>So is that the way you wrote
                            songs on the early albums...you did the
                            music, and would you do the lyrics as well?</b></font><br>
                    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2">Well, on the very first Omen record, I wrote lyrics
                        to
                        a couple of the songs. A few of those songs were originally Savage Grace songs.
                        But I’m not really that comfortable being the lyricist. I mean, I can do it,
                        but it’s just not my forte, and it’s so stressful for me, because I don’t want
                        it to be stupid [laughs]. Like &quot;Oh he’s writing the lyrics? Well, those suck!&quot;
                        So with the traditional Omen, on the first three or four records, we would
                        write the music and then I would hand the tapes over to J.D. (Kimball, vocals) and
                        he’d come in with lyric ideas. I would always tweak `em, I always have an input
                        on `em, but I prefer to work with somebody who’s going to handle their end of
                        that, as long as it’s in the vein of what we’re doing.</font>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2" color="#0060CC"><b>Right, there was a medieval
                            flavor to a lot of the lyrics.</b></font><br>
                    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2">Exactly. And I’ve usually got my hands full. I’m
                        usually producing or co-producing, and on the last record and this one I’m
                        full-on producing and engineering. So I don’t really need to be trying to write
                        lyrics <i>and</i> play guitar <i>and</i> produce <i>and</i> engineer. I had to
                        do a lot of that on the last record, I had to write a lot of lyrics and stuff,
                        and it didn’t really turn out to be a very fun experience. It was a little bit
                        too much of a load.</font>
                </p>

                    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2" color="#0060CC"><b>I think it’s often good for the
                            singer to write lyrics, since he’s
                            going to be carrying the vocal lines.</b></font><br>
                    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2">Right. You want him to do something that he’s
                        comfortable with.</font>

                            the music for the first few Omen

                        Well,
                        actually I wrote almost all of <b><i>The Curse</i></b> at my mother’s house. We
                        had just come off tour and I went to my mother’s house in Oklahoma and sat on
                        the front porch with my red Charvel, unplugged, and wrote 95% of the music for <b><i>The
                                Curse</i></b>, with no amp. I just sat there and picked it out, then we went
                        back to L.A. and we worked up the tunes, and then J.D. came in and we did the
                        lyrics. That’s generally how it worked: writing the music and then giving it to
                        the singer.</font>

                    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2">Actually, we had written probably over half of the
                        stuff for this record musically before we hired Kevin. We were looking for a
                        singer, so we just started writing music. We brought in two or three guys and
                        looked at them, and Kevin definitely had the most traditional Omen sound. He
                        really seemed to be into it, a hard worker. That’s what I wanted to find,
                        somebody who wanted to put out the same kind of effort that I was.</font>

                            open call for a vocalist, or did
                            you just go to a couple of clubs and say, &quot;That guy would be good, let’s steal
                            him.&quot;</b></font><br>
                    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif" size="2">Well, we didn’t put out an open call at all,
                        because I
                        just didn’t want to deal with all that. I’ve been around Dallas, and I’ve seen
                        a couple of singers in bands around here over the years. We tried this other
                        guy, Matt (Story). He had a great voice, but his work ethic wasn’t really that
                        heavy, and I really didn’t want to get back into being the person that had to
                        write the lyrics again. And we’d known Kevin forever; he’d been around in bands
                        around Dallas. So Andy (Haas, bass) said, &quot;You know, we really need to try
                        Kevin.&quot; I didn’t know, but we brought him over and I was blown away. I mean,
                        he’s not Geoff Tate, but his voice is great and he’s into the traditional Omen
                        sound. He’s more of a Dio type of voice, with a little bit of J.D. thrown in
                        there. I don’t think anybody’s going to be disappointed.</font>

                        still a close friend, but his job was taking up so much of his time. It was
                        going to be like it was on <b><i>Reopening</i></b> where I would have to try to

                        Austin, and he did the vocals and sent it back. But I see him from time to time

                        we got some regional radio play. We were pretty much out on the road every

                        Kansas and Louisiana. I had a good time in that band. The music didn’t really
                        turn me on, but I had just come out of the big breakup of Omen. I was kind of
                        depressed about the music business in general, and it was a fun band. I had a
                        good time, but it got to the point where I was like, &quot;Well, this is fun, but I
                        really would like to go back to playing by myself.&quot; So I decided that we were
                        going to spread ways and that I was going to put the Omen back together, and I
                        never really thought about playing with anybody else but Andy. We’ve just been
                        close friends for so long, stood by each other through thick and thin, and it
                        never crossed my mind to use anybody else but him.</font>

                        pounded it into him! [laughs] We just kept making him play the old stuff over
                        and over again, and I think he’s playing a whole lot more like traditional Omen
                        on this thing. Like I said, Rick and my son are younger and they’re both into
                        newer-sounding stuff, Pantera and stuff like that, and I probably compromised a
                        lot more than I should have on the last record. But Rick has stayed through it,
                        worked on his playing, and worked on playing more in the style of what we were
                        doing before. I think the European tour helped a lot, when he saw how much
                        people loved the old stuff. He’s played really well, and he’s cut some really
                        good tracks on this record.</font>
