            Loudness Article for Heavy Metal Forces USA: Thunder in the USA
        </h2>

        <p>
            What an amazing couple of months this has been for Japanese metal in the USA. In October `05 I got to see
            Sex
            Machineguns (my favorite Japanese metal band) play their first US live gig [read the live review], and now
            in April `06 here comes Loudness to small NC club. I mean, those guys are like the godfathers of Japanese
            metal...back in the day, being a US fan of Japanese metal was pretty much defined in terms of which Loudness
            record was your favorite, or maybe if you'd ever heard of Anthem. Even though bands like Sex Machineguns and
            X Japan have managed to gain some dedicated American fans, most Japanese metal remains a sort of underground
            entity, and Loudness was probably the band that cracked the mainstream metal market more than any other
            band.Yamashita san's bass pick from the 2006 US tour Back in the 80s, the band was reasonably popular and
            respected, and they even took a shot with an American singer for a while [read the interview with Mike
            Vescera]. These days, many US metalheads would probably be surprised to learn that Loudness actually never
            broke up and has continued to churn out records in their homeland. Finally, the band has reformed with its
            original "classic" lineup, has secured some European distribution for the new albums, and has returned to
            the US for its first American tour in 15 years.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'll admit that I approached this gig with a mixture of excitement and apprehension. After all, how could I
            not consider myself lucky to be able to catch a live show from a legendary Japanese band that I'd been
            listening to for more than half of my life? On the other hand, I have not picked up a Loudness album in at
            least 15 years (my last one was <b><i>Soldier of Fortune back</i></b> in 1989). I heard some of the
            midperiod stuff, but by that time guitarist Akira Takasaki was
            the only original member left and the material seemed different somehow. The original members are back now,
            but the reunion stuff has consistently ventured into a newer style with lots of drop tuning and groove riffs
            that are a distinct departure from the band's "classic" sound. The set list for the US shows was pretty much
            the same for the duration of the tour and included a mix of old and new songs, so I was certainly looking
            forward to hearing the old material, and I was curious to see how the new tunes went over at a live show.
        </p>

        <p>
            The "Thunder in the USA" tour included only 13 dates across the entire US, so I was quite surprised to learn
            that Loudness was playing in Fayetteville, NC, a smallish military town that is less than 90 minutes from my
            house. I arranged to meet up with one of my best friends, and we showed up very early at Jesters, a small
            club tucked away behind a grocery store (you'd never find it if you weren't looking for it). We were
            checking out the tour buses behind the club, and turns out that my buddy knew Loudness' US tour manager (a
            guy named Danny Stanton, former singer for Takashi and tour manager for Thin Lizzy, WASP, and others).
            Anyway, we'd hoped to see Loudness before the show, but Danny told us that the band usually arrived at the
            club late in the evening, just in time to warm up and go on stage. Major drag. In the end, it was a good
            thing that we did have some extra time before the gig started. As we entered the club, we were frisked at
            the door and told that no digital cameras were allowed inside the venue. (I believe that this was the club's
            policy and had nothing to do with Loudness; I've seen nice, clean photos—and even some bootleg video—from
            other Loudness gigs on this tour.) So we headed to the grocery store to buy a bunch of disposable cameras
            (hence the average quality of the photos included with this live report — blame Jesters, not me).
        </p>

        <p>
            We finally got inside the club about 30 minutes before showtime, and we were startled to find that the place
            was virtually empty. The stage area was a decent size, but the club itself was not large (rather small in
            light of the arena-sized venues that Loudness commands back in Japan). I had assumed that Loudness would be
            a pretty big draw, and I knew that the show in Virginia the night before had sold out completely. NC's own
            Widow was also scheduled to play as the second band of the night, so I had expected some local metal militia
            to show up for them too. (Japanese metalheads may have picked up Widow's latest album on Spiritual Beast
            Records in Japan.) Thanks to a connection through HMF's own AK Nakagawa, I'd arranged to meet up with some
            of the guys from Widow, so we hung out for a bit and shared a few beers while the first band got ready to
            play.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of my local favorites, Frexon Zo, was slated to be the first band on the bill for this gig, but FZ had
            to back out at the last minute. Doh! The replacement opener, a relatively new local band called Hellrazor,
            took the stage promptly at 8pm—I love it when a gig starts on time. I guess it's tough to open up for a
            big-name headliner, and it must be even worse when the club is pretty well deserted. I'd seen the band
            before, so some of the material seemed familiar...decent riffs but not particularly memorable, and too much
            "are you ready to @*&%$ rock" conversation for me. To Hellrazor's credit, they knocked out their set of
            original material (plus one Ozzy cover that was probably a mistake) in the face of utter indifference from
            the small crowd, although more folks had drifted into the place by the end of the band's set.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm almost ashamed to admit that I'd never seen Widow play before...the band is practically a NC
            institution,
            but this was my first chance to check them out in concert. (Sorry AK!) Unfortunately, the band's set was
            plagued by technical problems, as the guitars kept cutting in and out while, almost paradoxically, the
            vocals were buried in the mix. Loudness at Jesters - photo from official Loudness web siteEven so, the Widow
            crew whipped through a good cross-section of material from their releases, hitting on newer tunes like "Here
            to Stay" and closing with fan favorite "Angel Sin". I think that the best part about the Widow set was that
            the band was clearly having a lot of fun...yeah, the sound was lousy and the club was still not very
            crowded, but how cool is it to be an opening act for metal legends from Japan? At one point in the
            between-song chatter, guitarist Cristof summed it up nicely by saying something like, "Man, I can't believe
            that we are opening up for Loudness! I grew up listening to these guys!" Me too, Cristof...me too...
        </p>

        <p>
            While Widow was tearing down their gear, my buddy and I staked out a good spot right in front of the stage,
            on little bit on the left side (this turned out to be Yamashita san's side of the stage). There were
            definitely more people in the club now, although I'd still be surprised if there were more than 100 - 125
            people there. As you might expect, most of the Loudness tour crew members were Japanese, and they got the
            band's gear set up quickly. Earlier in the evening, when we were out back by the tour buses, we'd heard the
            Jesters crew talking about their setup activities with the Loudness crew. Apparently, the in-house lighting
            rig could get overloaded easily, but the Jesters team wasn't sure that the Loudness crew understood that
            they could not turn the lights up to maximum power for an extended period of time. A trio of Japanese
            legendsToo much power would blow the circuits, and then somebody would have to climb up to the ceiling to
            fix the lights. Remember that I mentioned this—it'll come in useful later...
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, the lights went down and it was time for the main show...Loudness! Unfortunately, someone went a
            little overboard with the smoke machine on the side of the stage, because we could barely see the band climb
            onstage while the taped intro played. Then the lights went up and can you believe that I am this close to
            Loudness?! I could hardly believe it myself. After watching so many live videos of the band from their 80s
            heyday, with the crazy hair and flashy outfits, I was really glad to see the guys dressed comfortably in
            track suits and sneakers.I was also quite grateful that Takasaki san was not wearing his ridiculous
            dreadlocks wig (check the picture at top of this review to see what I mean), opting for a simple baseball
            cap instead. And even though the stage was relatively small, there was an elevated drum riser in the back,
            so I could see Higuchi san really well for the entire show.
        </p>

        <P>
            The band did not waste any time getting kicking off their show and immediately launched into "Exultation"
            and "Lunatic", a pair of songs from their more recent albums. I mentioned before that I was not particularly
            fond of the band's current style of material, and this gig did little to change my mind about that. I'm not
            really looking for this kind of pseudo-thrash stuff from Loudness, and I like it much better when Niihara
            san sings instead of shouting a song title repeatedly. So I wasn't familiar with the first two songs, but it
            was easy enough to pick up the rhythms and find the choruses, so I sang right along. Thankfully, the sound
            and mix were quite good (much improved from the Widow set), and the band was tight as hell, but could
            someone please turn off that infernal smoke machine? Anyway, I had already seen the order for the set list
            (and could see it taped to the floor at Yamashita san's feet), so I knew that the upcoming trio of older
            tunes was going to be the highlight of the show for me.
        </P>

        <p>
            Sure enough, Niihara san chatted with the crowd for a few minutes while Takasaki san changed out his
            guitars, swapping his down-tuned model for an orange Killer axe that was tuned for the older material. When
            he started off the riff for "Crazy Nights", the crowd definitely responded with all of their shouting
            power...these were tunes that people had been waiting to hear, and thankfully someone had finally turned
            down the smoke machine so that we could actually see the band. The excitement did not stop for an instant as
            the band raced straight into smoking versions of "Crazy Doctor" and "In the Mirror." The audience was fully
            involved now, screaming out the lyrics and pumping fists in time with the songs. The band responded with
            equal intensity and delivered absolutely ferocious versions of these tunes, prowling the small stage and
            exhorting the fans to sing louder and make more noise. Yamashita san and Higuchi san have a quick smoke
            breakMan, talk about dream fulfillment...these are such classic songs that sound just as righteous now as
            they did 20 years ago, so it was wonderful to experience these tunes live in the hands of the masters
            themselves...take me away from here forever, indeed...
        </p>

        <p>
            Unlike the Sex Machineguns show in Nashville, where each band member had a chance to talk to the crowd,
            Niihara san did all the talking for Loudness. He seemed very comfortable, and he was actually a pretty funny
            guy, cracking some jokes in between songs. He commented that it was tricky to be an international rock band
            from Japan, since he had to do so much talking in English, and then laughed and said, "You know, I don't
            even know what I am saying in Japanese most of the time!" Hah! And of course, he got the crowd cheering when
            he explained that "some words are very difficult for me to say in English...I had to work on this all day so
            I could say: Hello North Car-o-lina!" Yamashita san was a bit of clown also, grinning at the crowd and doing
            bizarre tricks like smoking a between-tune cigarette with his right eye socket (no kidding!).
        </p>

        <p>
            Back to the new material now, with Takasaki san switching to his drop-tuned guitar and Niihara san
            explaining that Loudness had lots of new music...apparently, they realized that many of the fans may not
            have known about the band's current albums. The guitar swap was handled quickly and then up came a batch of
            "reunion" tunes. I'd heard "The Winds of Victory" before but did not remember it very well, and I wasn't
            familiar with "Crazy Samurai" at all, although I believe it is a single from the most recent studio release,
            <b><i>Racing</i></b> (which was also released in a separate English version, like <b><i>Disillusion</i></b>
            was back in the 80s).
            Takasaki san rocks out with the crowd in FayettevillePart of the crowd seemed to be really into the new
            stuff, so that was very cool, but from listening to shouted song requests and crowd chatter, I got the
            feeling that there were other gaijin who, like me, were eager for more old songs from the glory days of the
            band.
        </p>

        <p>
            It must be very difficult for bands with such lengthy careers to choose a set list, since there is so much
            material to draw from and so many "fan favorites" to consider. Even so, I question the placement of "Cross"
            in the middle of the set list. I didn't know the song, and it seemed that few others knew it either, and the
            slow, doomy pace of the tune kind of killed the momentum that the gig had built up. The song was quite long
            (or seemed that way), with multiple stops and starts, and the crowd seemed to lose interest, even though
            Takasaki san was playing a pretty cool guitar that had lights on it. When the tune was finally done, I am
            not sure that anybody was really sure that it was over...the band hit the final note and let the guitar
            chord fade out, and there was total silence in the club...only when Niihara san said, "Thank you very much!"
            did we realize that the song was over. It was kind of weird, really...
        </p>

        <p>
            According to the set list taped to the stage, the "official" set was almost over, even though the band had
            not even been playing for an hour. "The Pandemonium" was up next, another new tune, and then it was time for
            the final song, a brisk older tune called "S.D.I." that was an nice choice to close the first part of the
            show, with a great riff and a good sing-along chorus. Still, the set seemed far too short, especially since
            there had been no songs from <b><i>Shadows of War</i></b> (aka <b><i>Lightning Strikes</i></b>), which was
            one of more popular Loudness
            albums here in the US. It seemed that most of the crowd didn't know that there were at least two planned
            encores, so there were lots of shouts for more songs, and specifically for "Let It Go" (which is a great
            song, but I think there are much better tunes from the <b><i>SoW</i></b> record, such as the killer title
            track).
        </p>

        <p>
            And remember what I mentioned earlier about the lighting rig getting overloaded easily? Well, I suppose that
            the stage crew got a little carried away on the final song and cranked up the lights, because as the band
            was winding down on "S.D.I." and saying good-bye, the lights sparked and flashed, and the band left the
            stage in darkness. Niihara san sings some classic Loudness for the US fansWe weren't sure what exactly had
            happened, but soon a few members of the Jesters crew showed up, placed a ladder in the middle of the stage,
            and climbed up to work on the lighting rig. It really didn't take that long for them to fix the problem, but
            the crowd was ready for more metal, chanting "Loudness! Loudness!" and " Let It Go! Let It Go!" over and
            over and shouting for more songs. After a few minutes, the crowd started getting rather restless, as if the
            band were intentionally making us wait for the encore, even though it was pretty obvious that the show could
            not start again until the lights were fixed. Finally, the Jesters guys finished up and whisked away the
            ladder, then it was time for more Loudness!
        </p>

        <p>
            While the band got settled back in with their instruments, Niihara san talked to us for a bit, told us how
            much fun they'd had playing for US audiences again, and reminded us about their current albums. This little
            chat led straight into "The Battleship Musashi", a current maxi-single that is more in the thrashier style.
            I was waiting for a guitar change before the band launched into "Rock Shock", but Takasaki san kept his
            droptuned axe for a slightly different version of the classic song. I remembered that Loudness had recently
            released a compilation album featuring rerecorded versions of older material, so I assume that we were
            hearing the updated live version, which seemed to be in a lower key and also changed the chorus a little bit
            (but not a change for the better—I prefer the original version, which is probably why I never bought the
            album of rerecordings). If the different version confused anybody else, I certainly could not tell, because
            the fans had their fists up and their voices raised to scream along with every word. So much for the first
            encore...
        </p>

        <p>
            Another break for the band, and now the crowd was nearly going insane to hear something from
            <b><i>SoW</i></b>, back to
            chanting "Let It Go!" and generally shouting for more thunder from the East. The band came back pretty
            quickly, and I must admit that I was delighted to see Takasaki san with his orange guitar—that meant classic
            material with the original tuning! Yamashita san rocks out some bass lines in FayettevilleNiihara san could
            clearly tell that we were hyped up for more metal, and I think the band just had a good time basking in the
            moment before beginning the next song. Takasaki san had a wonderfully sly grin on his face as he kicked into
            the opening riff to "Let It Go", and the whole audience (myself included) pretty much went berserk. Niihara
            san could have stopped singing at any time, and I think that the audience would have been loud enough to
            fill in with every word of the song...
        </p>

        <p>
            But wait a second, why are they stopping after the first chorus? Surely they aren't going to play a
            shortened version of the one song that fans have been shouting for all night...yeah, that's exactly what
            they're doing, playing a transitional riff and heading straight into "Like Hell", the final tune of the
            evening. Don't get me wrong—I think that "Like Hell" is a great song, and the chorus is perfect for a live
            show since the audience can sing along easily...but what was the point of only playing half of "Let It Go"?
            I believe the tune was a late addition to the set list for the tour, but they'd played it at several shows
            before arriving in NC, so it's not like they would have been unprepared to rock out the whole tune. Anyway,
            everyone was at fever pitch for the last song, lots of shouting and headbanging from the audience ("Like
            Hell! Gonna rock you like Hell!"), and lots of "Thank you, North Car-o-lina!" from Loudness...and then all
            of a sudden it was over, and that's a drag...
        </p>

        <p>
            When the house lights came up, we knew that the show was really finished, and I could still hardly believe
            that I had been so close to such a legendary band. I was certainly impressed by the show...yeah, I wanted
            more songs, but I would have wanted more even if the band had played for three hours! Niihara san's voice
            was still more than strong enough to handle the classic material, and he was an excellent frontman,
            completely comfortable as host for the evening.Takasaki san proved that his reputation as a veritable
            guitar god is well deserved, as his deft playing exuded a sense of effortless precision and absolute
            control. He also came across as very humble in his performance...no showboating or overplaying, just
            comfortable mastery of his instrument that was inspiring to witness. Yamashita san seems to be often
            overlooked in this band (or perhaps he just likes to keep a lower profile), but his playing was great and he
            loved interacting with the crowd (he gave my buddy and me his last two bass picks at the end of the night).
            He wore a tremendous grin as he nailed down the bottom end all night long, and every now and then he'd throw
            in a little bass trick or play his lines with his left hand on top of the frets (instead of holding the bass
            neck in his palm). Speaking as a drummer, I was especially excited to see Higuchi san play in a live
            setting. He certainly played well this night, but he appeared to be uncomfortable or even possibly in some
            pain, and by the end of the first few songs, it seemed that he was struggling to play his kit. His
            performance was still solid and he missed not a single note throughout the evening, but I've watched his
            playing enough over the years to realize that the fluid grace he usually exhibits was definitely missing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tour manager Danny had told us that the Loudness guys usually hung out near the tour buses after the show,
            so we were quite hopeful that we'd get to meet the band and get some autographs. But it was still pretty
            early (not even midnight yet), so my pals and I decided to hang out in club for a while to see if the band
            would show up there first. Sure enough, Higuchi san showed up in front of the stage a few minutes later. I
            don't think he intended to do a meet-and-greet at that point (he was probably checking on gear or
            something), but he was instantly mobbed by fans who saw him (actually, most of the crowd did not notice that
            he was there). He signed a bunch of stuff for people before going backstage again, and it was cool to see
            fans with classic Loudness items (<b><i>Law of Devils Land</i></b> LPs and things like that).
        </p>

        <p>
            Over the course of the next 20 minutes or so, the rest of the band came out from the back, one by one. I
            have no idea how concerts are organized in Japan or if fans ever get the opportunity to meet the band
            members, but I found it almost surreal to be talking to Yamashita san in a small club in NC. He signed all
            of the CD booklets that my buddy and I had brought, and he seemed amused when we told him we wished they's
            played "Shadows of War" or "Die of Hunger" during the show. Higuchi san was equally cool, signing everything
            we had, and even searching for his photo on most of the booklets so that he could sign in the correct place.
            We found Takasaki san over at the bar, relaxing with a drink and just hanging out. He was so very humble as
            he signed all of our stuff, and he seemed genuinely surprised that so many of the fans had such extensive
            collections of Loudness items. I did notice, however, that almost all of the CDs that fans had were "older"
            material, with only a few newer releases showing up. I also realized that I'd forgotten to bring all of my
            Loudness-related project stuff...Lazy, Misako Honjoh, Mari Hamada, Animetal, and whatever else I've got.
            Doh! We finally caught up with Niihara san in the middle of a group of fans. He was very pleasant and
            gracious, and he gave a "thumbs up" when I had him sign the X.Y.Z.→ A CDs that I'd brought. Of course, I
            also had him sign my copy of HMF Vol. 2, which features X.Y.Z.→ A on the cover—he was very surprised to see
            that!

            What an awesome night this was, although I was rather disappointed that the set list was so short. I mean,
            10 tunes for the "main" set is really not much, especially for a band that has such a massive back catalog
            of killer albums. I certainly understand that the band would want to hit on a lot of their newer music; at
            the end of the day, touring is all about promotion, so it makes perfect sense that they would push material
            from recent albums. But the entire set was only 13.5 tunes - that's less than 90 minutes...if you're going
            to come all the way over to the US for a tour, then bring a full set of songs, do 2 hours of stuff, add in a
            few more old classics..."Esper" or anything from <b><i>Shadows of War</i></b> or maybe a surprise like "Black Wall". In
            the end, though, this was an amazing experience, and I feel extremely lucky that I was able to see such a
            hugely successful band in such a small club, since I doubt that this kind of tour happens very often (I
            can't imagine the expense involved in orchestrating something like this). I am hopeful that the band enjoyed
            their quick trip across America, and I hope that they will return again soon...I don't want to wait another
            15 years!
