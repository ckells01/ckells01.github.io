    <h2>
      Interview with Satan
    </h2>

    <p>October 23, 2016</p>

    <p>Satan shouldn’t really be touring the U.S. right now. In truth, the band essentially broke up several decades
      ago. When the classic <b>Court in the Act</b> lineup reunited to play the Keep
      It True festival in 2011, it was actually intended to be a one-time
      performance. Instead, the rabid audience response catalyzed the full-fledged
      revival of a band that never really got proper recognition for its place in the
      annals of NWOBHM history.</p>

    <p>A handful of years and two albums
      later, Satan returned to North America in October 2016 for a series of 10 shows
      (two in Canada, eight in the U.S.) to close the touring chapter on 2015’s <b>Atom
        by Atom</b> album. Canadian trio Cauldron accompanied the band as direct
      support, which made for a nice touring package. </p>

    <p>Planning a tour in the US can be
      quite a logistical challenge, as big cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and New
      York are spread across thousands of miles. Satan had done a couple of shows on
      the west coast earlier in the spring, but nothing nearby (except a short slot
      at Maryland Deathfest in March). When the U.S. tour stops for October were
      announced, shows in Pennsylvania and Virginia stood out as the best chances to
      catch the band a couple times. (More is always better.)</p>

    <p>The gig in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
      was scheduled at Boot and Saddle, a western-themed club with a bar in front and
      a separate stage room in back. And guess who was hanging around the bar for
      most of the evening? Satan, of course. This is not a band that hides in a
      dressing room until it’s time to take the stage. These guys are amazingly
      accessible and approachable, and it’s almost surreal to realize that many of
      the metalheads in the bar had no idea that they were standing next to members
      of the band they’d come to see.</p>

    <p>Indeed, it’s like the guys are
      locals instead of a touring band from England. Look, there’s guitarist Steve
      Ramsey and drummer Sean Taylor loading in their own gear from a trailer in
      front of the club. There goes bassist Graeme English to search for a shop to
      buy some wine, and there goes guitarist Russ Tippins to grab a beer at the bar
      and chat with fans. And here’s vocalist Brian Ross, mingling about and happy to
      talk on subjects ranging from his favorite drink (a double shot with equal
      parts Jagermeister and Fireball that he calls The Firemeister) to his thoughts
      on Stryper to the details of Alice Cooper’s Nightmare, his theatrical tribute
      to classic Cooper material. (Seriously, check it out – it’s a stellar
      production.)</p>

    <p>The dual lineup of Satan and
      Cauldron was supported by local acts for each tour stop. In Philadelphia, that
      meant the evening started with Horrendous, a death metal band that did not
      really seem to fit with the lineup all that well. Still, the band drew a decent
      crowd into the stage room, which filled up even more as Cauldron whipped
      through their set of catchy metallic anthems. </p>

    <p>By the time the lights dimmed and
      the taped “Into the Fire” intro began to play, the stage room was packed with
      fans, probably pushing the limit of the room’s capacity of 150 souls. The stage
      was not very big for a band with five members, but it didn’t seem to matter –
      these guys are an absolutely lethal musical unit. The guitar team of Russ and
      Steve is simply stellar and should rank with the top six-string duos in
      metaldom, and they were certainly on fire in Philadelphia. The Sean/Graeme
      rhythm section threw down the perfect foundation for the songs, and Brian’s
      vocals were like a time machine – he sounded amazing and hit his piercing high
      notes with what seemed to be little effort. When asked how he maintained his
      vocal range for so many years, he replied simply, “It’s my job.” Fair enough,
      and job well done, sir.</p>

    <p>Given the staggeringly consistent
      strength of the material in the band’s catalog, it’s not likely that the boys
      could assemble a dull set list even if they tried. The song selection for this
      tour was similar to that used during the summer’s European run, with a few
      slight adjustments. Recent songs like “My Own God” and “Atom by Atom” were
      dropped from the set, while the epic album closer “Fall of Persephone” was
      added. The rest of the tunes were drawn mainly from the Brian-era albums, with
      nothing from <b>Suspended Sentence</b> or <b>Into the Future</b> showing up.
      (The 2014 U.S. tour included “Ice Man” from that latter release.)</p>

    <p>Brian mentioned
      that, while the band does tweak the set list somewhat in order to keep things
      interesting, it does get harder to balance the older material with new songs.
      “Almost half of the set is made of songs that we always need to play,” he says.
      Indeed, tracks like “Trial by Fire” and “Blades of Steel” seem almost expected
      by the gathered crowd, and it’s amazing that the band still serves up gems like
      “Oppression” and “Kiss of Death” from their very first demo release way back in
      1981. </p>

    <p>But what about
      mounting a tour called “Hunt You Down in North America” but not playing the
      song of the same name? What’s up with that? “That’s a good point!” laughed
      Brian. “We haven’t played ‘Hunt You Down’ in several years, so it actually
      won’t show up in the set on this tour.” Oh well – maybe next time.</p>

    <p>This was only
      the second night of the tour, but it was also the second night that the set was
      affected by a venue curfew. In New York the night before, the band only got to
      play 10 songs before they had to stop. Philadelphia got a dozen songs, although
      at least one song (“Farewell Evolution”) had to be skipped, and the final
      encore tune was played while the house lights flashed as a signal to end the
      show.</p>

    <p>Afterward, the
      band was immediately back in the bar – autographing albums, taking pictures,
      and just hanging out with the crowd of black-shirted longhairs. It’s impossible
      to miss that these guys really do appreciate their fans and are keenly aware
      that they’re making new fans while keeping their existing base. Brian expressed
      a sort of delighted satisfaction that every night they see young fans who know
      the classic 80s songs just as well as the older fans. “Some of these younger
      guys weren’t even born when <b>Court in the Act</b> was released, but they know
      every word to every song,” he said. “It’s amazing!”</p>

    <p>With the
      Philadelphia show a definite success, it was on to Richmond, Virginia, for the
      third stop of the tour. Satan played Richmond on their 2014 U.S. tour but was
      booked into a much nicer venue for this visit. The Broadberry featured one long
      room with a good stage and excellent sound. </p>

    <p>Even better,
      the local openers were a great musical match for the touring bands. Humungus
      started the night off with a batch of speedy songs that brought to mind old
      Heathen, with tons of melodic guitar work and great high-pitched vocal from
      both lead singer and guitarist. BAT was next, a Motörhead/Venom-style trio with
      members of Municipal Waste, Volture and D.R.I. They blasted their way through a
      strong set before Cauldron came on to warm up the crowd for the main event…</p>

    <p>After
      witnessing six Satan gigs in the past two years, it’s become clear that these
      guys are consistently on point each and every time they take the stage. The
      guitar licks are just right, the bass runs cut through, the drum intros are
      crisp and clear, and the high screams are just perfect. But more surprising is
      that the band’s energy often spawns an active mosh pit, especially during the
      faster songs. This tour proved no different, as both shows got very rough in
      spots (no stage-diving, though). </p>

    <p>The Richmond faithful
      also got an extra treat, courtesy of Steve’s guitar amp. He was having issues
      with it during “Blades of Steel” before it died completely at the end of that
      song. While the crew worked on the amp, Brian chatted comfortably with the
      audience for a couple of minutes until Russ started playing the riff from Jimi
      Hendrix’s “Voodoo Child (Slight Return).” Sean quickly joined in, and Brian
      sang a few lines but then stepped back and let the song flow as an improvised
      instrumental. It has to be said that Russ plays a mean guitar well beyond the
      standard metal style, which isn’t really that surprising to anyone who’s heard
      his solo music. (If you’ve not checked out his two records with the Russ
      Tippins Electric Band, then you’re missing out on some fantastic blues rock.
      Russ leads the trio with his deft guitar mastery and also delivers a tremendous
      vocal performance.)</p>

    <p>Satan blazed
      through their full set, pausing for a brief ambient intro in the middle and
      only leaving the stage for a quick minute before delivering a pair of encore
      songs. The crowd stayed strong for every note, and even though it was a Sunday
      night, the sing-a-long melody at the end of “Kiss of Death” was loud and proud.</p>

    <p>Clearly the U.S.
      fans are enjoying the band’s revival and the touring attention that never
      happened back in the day. Hopefully the boys in Satan are having an equal
      amount of fun. Watching the opening bands from a booth in the back of the club,
      Sean seemed to be quite pleased with how the tour was going. “I get to use the
      same drum kit every night!” he exclaimed with a grin. A small thing, perhaps,
      but having a touring partner this time meant that Sean got to use the Cauldron
      kit every night, a big change from the 2014 tour which required him to use
      whatever local drum set was available at each gig.</p>

    <p>And so it goes,
      city to city, atom by atom, taking over the U.S. This is a hard-working band,
      with another album on the way, plus full-time gigs with Blitzkrieg and Skyclad
      in the mix. HMF caught up with Steve at the Richmond gig, where he was hanging
      out on the club’s back patio. He was kind enough to grab Brian so that they
      could both take a few minutes to chat about the current and forthcoming albums,
      the band’s future plans, and all kinds of other things…</p>

    <p><b><u>Interview with Brian Ross and Steve Ramsey of Satan</u></b></p>

    <p>HMF: You’ve been touring for <b>Atom by Atom</b> for about a year now. What is next after this series of North
      American dates? What does 2017 look like for the band?</p>

    <p>Brian: This is pretty much the end of our touring for this album.</p>

    <p>Steve: Right. We have a couple of shows in Finland [in November], but the plan is to do a new record next year.
      We’ve already started doing a bit of work toward that. </p>

    <p>HMF: Was there any material left from the <b>Atom by Atom</b> sessions?</p>

    <p>Brian: There are four or five songs left over from <b>Atom by Atom</b> so we do have a kind of head start on
      the next album. We didn’t want to put any more songs on <b>Atom by Atom</b>,
      but we didn’t leave any songs off because they weren’t as good the rest.</p>

    <p>Steve: One of the songs we left off <b>Atom by Atom</b> is my favorite one. [laughs] We had to do a vote on
      which songs we were going to use. We each wrote down the 10 songs that should
      be on the album and worked it out that way.</p>

    <p>Brian: It was really hard. We tried to simply talk about all the songs and which ones to use. But as Steve
      said, in the end we had to write down our choices to make the decision.</p>

    <p>HMF: Congratulations to you, Steve, for agreeing to leave off your favorite song.</p>

    <p>Steve: Well, I knew that song would go on the next album! [laughs]</p>

    <p>Brian: Yes – it’s a great song. They’re all great songs. It’s nice to have a head start on a new album.</p>

    <p>HMF: That’s something of a luxury, isn’t it? Did you have any songs left over from <b>Life Sentence</b>?</p>

    <p>Steve: This is the first time we’ve really had a lot of extra material.</p>

    <p>Brian: We had the music for “My Own God” but that was about it. This time, we have a bit more to work with, so
      it’s not a bad start.</p>

    <p>HMF: Is there more pressure now? When you did your comeback album <b>Life Sentence</b>, you could write it
      without any real notion of how it would be received.</p>

    <p>Brian: We had no idea at all how it was going to be received. All we knew is that we made a conscious effort to
      write the album that would have followed <b>Court in the Act</b>. So if we had
      made that follow-up album in 1984, what would it have sounded like? We wrote <b>Life
        Sentence</b> based on that idea. With <b>Atom by Atom</b> we didn’t do that. We
      just wrote what we felt at the time. But we are very aware that <b>Court in the
        Act</b> is considered something of a classic album, and how do you follow that?
      It’s hard to do, to recapture what you had. Many bands come back and reform
      after many years, but they can’t make it work. </p>

    <p>HMF: But you guys still have that special chemistry.</p>

    <p>Brian: Honestly, when you put the five of us in a room together, it just works. There’s a spark of magic there. I
      don’t know what it is, but it just works. If we could put this in a bottle and sell it, we’d make a fortune.</p>

    <p>Steve: We knew it from the very first rehearsal. We could tell that the magic was still there.</p>

    <p>Brian: It had been 28 years, but it felt like we’d just been together last week.</p>

    <p>HMF: Did that increase the pressure for <b>Atom by Atom</b>? You came back, found the magic, made <b>Life
        Sentence</b> and blew everyone away. But then you had to do it again on the
      follow-up album.</p>

    <p>Brian: It was hard from that angle, but at least we knew that the fans were still there and still behind us.
      With <b>Life Sentence</b> we really didn’t know what to expect. But there
      certainly was pressure to come up with another album that was just as good. </p>

    <p>Steve: Musically, <b>Atom by Atom</b> is more progressive as well. For <b>Life Sentence</b> we tried to think of
      what
      our technical and song-writing abilities would have been back when we were 20
      or 22 years old. But we took those shackles off when we wrote <b>Atom by Atom</b>.</p>

    <p>HMF: Is that why songs like “Fall of Persephone” have some more complex arangements?</p>

    <p>Steve: Right. We wouldn’t have done something like that in the early days.</p>

    <p>HMF: So you don’t have to discard any musical ideas. You can add a progressive element if that is how you feel a
      song taking shape.</p>

    <p>Steve: Exactly!</p>

    <p>Brian: I think the only way we would reject a song is if we listen to it and say, “That doesn’t sound like
      Satan.” But that hasn’t happened yet.</p>

    <p>HMF: Lyrically, it seems like <b>Atom by Atom</b> has a darker tone. Do you have a plan that the new album will
      be similar, or will there be a different approach? How does the concept for an album emerge?</p>

    <p>Steve: We really don’t think of it when we’re writing. We just write the songs. But that’s how we chose the
      songs for <b>Atom by Atom</b>. When we all wrote down our favorites, there was
      this group of songs we all liked, and the album was forming with that sort of
      tone. So some of the songs were left off the album because they didn’t fit with
      that darker tone.</p>

    <p>Brian: The theme was rather poignant as well, with some of the things that were happening around the world,
      like terrorism. Those things were in the foreground, and that’s kind of dark.
      So from those influences, we just wrote in that way and the album turned out
      like that. But that’s what Satan is about. It’s about injustice and everything
      that goes with it. Satan is representative of what’s wrong with the world,
      what’s evil. We’ve never written any songs about Satan the guy. </p>

    <p>Steve: We don’t write about anything that has to do with the occult.</p>

    <p>Brian: I think he only gets one mention, at the end of “Alone in the Dock”…but people can get the wrong idea
      [because of the band name].</p>

    <p>HMF: True. And it’s definitely not a positive reference to Satan in that song… “Satan laughing creeps inside /
      Attracted by your wealth and greed” …he doesn’t come off well there. [laughs]</p>

    <p>Brian: No he doesn’t – and why would he? In that way, it’s talking about man, who is attracted by wealth and
      greed. But it has to be said that Satan is the best name for a metal band that
      there could possibly be. Not only that, if you look at the logo and flip it
      around, it’s exactly the same. </p>

    <p>HMF: Honestly, I’d never noticed that about the logo. It works for all the dyslexic metal fans out there.</p>

    <p>Brian: Look at it in the mirror. [laughs]</p>

    <p>HMF: You’ve used the image of a judge as a theme in your artwork. How do you decide on the album name and the
      accompanying cover art?</p>

    <p>Brian: Well, we gave that to the artist [Eliran Kantor], didn’t we? [looks at Steve]</p>

    <p>Steve: Yeah, we gave him two titles. We gave him “In Contempt”, one of the songs on the album that would
      have been more in trend with what we’d done with the justice theme. And we gave
      him “Atom by Atom” as well, and the song content on that one inspired him to do
      the artwork. That song is about one of the members of the band having some
      family problems, and the artist had experienced that with his own family.</p>

    <p>Brian: So we just let him [Eliran] come up with something, and he came up with a great cover sleeve.</p>

    <p>HMF: It’s great to be able to
      leave such things in the hands of someone you trust.</p>

    <p>Steve: Absolutely. Once we knew
      what he could do [on <b>Life Sentence</b>], we let him work it out. He’s the
      artist – we’re not artists like that. After we trusted him, we could let him
      create a view of what he thought would work.</p>

    <p>HMF: The same artist did the
      cover art for the <b>Trail of Fire</b> live album you released after the first
      U.S. tour in 2014. Are there any plans for a live DVD with this tour and
      possibly some archival stuff? Have you been filming any of your shows this
      year?</p>

    <p>Brian: I’d love to say yes, but
      I’m really not sure. We do have a lot of video material, so it’s possible. I
      personally would like to see something like that happen.</p>

    <p>Steve: We’ve had a few shows
      filmed so far. We filmed the Rock Hard Festival in Germany, and that came out
      pretty well. We’re just so busy at the moment that we haven’t had time to think
      about anything like that. But we’ll finish the tour and see what happens. We do
      have bits and pieces so maybe we can sort something out next year.</p>

    <p>HMF: Brian, you mentioned that
      you’re heading to Japan with Blitzkrieg next week [for Japanese Assault Fest 16
      in Tokyo].</p>

    <p>Brian: Right. I think I’m home
      for two days at the end of this North American Satan tour before I have to
      leave again to go to Japan. [laughs]</p>

    <p>HMF: And you’ve been to Japan
      with Satan as well. Back in the <b>Court in the Act</b> days, was there much
      fan contact from Japan?</p>

    <p>Steve: Back then we didn’t get
      any offer to play in Japan. Our records did get released over there, and we got
      plenty of fan mail from there.</p>

    <p>Brian: We never got the
      opportunity to play over there until recently [at Japanese Assault Fest 14], so
      that was good. It was nice to get over there.</p>

    <p>Steve: It’s weird, because back
      in the early 80s we’d get letters from Japan and all over the world, and we’d
      think, “Wow, imagine going there some day to play a show.” And now it’s
      happened…35 years later!</p>

    <p>HMF: I am glad it’s happening –
      it’s amazing that you are doing world tours and still making new music! And now
      you’ve been to Japan, North and South America, Europe, Scandinavia. What have
      the audience reactions been like in all the different places?</p>

    <p>Steve: It was fantastic in Japan.
      It was just unbelievable. We got to hang out with some fans after the shows.</p>

    <p>Brian: In some ways it’s
      different, but in some ways it’s exactly the same no matter where you are. I
      think it just comes across differently in different countries. In parts of
      Holland, for instance, we’ll play a song, and when it’s done we’ll get polite
      applause, and we’ll think, “Man, we’re dying up here.” But then when we
      announce it’s the last song of the night, the audience goes mental, and we’re
      like, “Why weren’t you cheering like that the whole time?!” But sometimes it’s
      like that. It’s kind of weird, but you get used to it, I suppose.</p>

    <p>Steve: Some places are crazier
      than others. In South America, the crowds were singing the riffs louder than we
      were playing them! It was amazing.</p>

    <p>Brian: We would turn up at the
      venues and get out of the transport, and there would be huge guys standing
      there crying and saying, “Look! It’s Satan! They’re here!”</p>

    <p>Steve: That happened in Japan as
      well. There were fans in tears, just overwhelmed. It’s totally over the top. </p>

    <p>Brian: There was a guy like that
      in New York on this tour…</p>

    <p>HMF: That was just a few nights
      ago.</p>

    <p>Brian: Yeah. The guy stood
      talking to me with tears in his eyes and said, “I’ve waited 30 years for this!”
      And all I could say was, “I hope it was worth it!”</p>

    <p>HMF: I think I can speak for most
      fans when I say that it’s wonderful to have you back in action! But both of you
      have other bands, too. Blitzkrieg is firing on all cylinders, and what about
      Skyclad?</p>

    <p>Steve: We’ve recorded a new
      album. It should be finished by Christmas and then out next year. And we have
      some gigs planned, like Rock Hard Festival in Germany. It’s funny, because we
      hadn’t had many offers [to do concerts] for a while. But we talked about
      announcing a new album, and now we’ve got all these things coming at us. We’re
      very busy.</p>

    <p>Brian: We are all very busy. And
      I think that Skyclad now are probably stronger than they’ve ever been. It’s
      nice to see that, because a lot of people may have had ideas on what Martin
      [Walkyier, original vocalist] was all about. But now I think Skyclad is a
      different beast, better and stronger than they’ve ever been. I can’t wait to
      hear the new album…they won’t let me hear it! [laughs]</p>

    <p>HMF: I’m ready for a new Skyclad
      record, too! It’s been a bunch of years since the last one. </p>

    <p>Steve: Yeah, it’s been a while.
      People have suggested that Satan must have interfered with Skyclad but that
      didn’t happen. The band was on a sort of hiatus. There are a few reasons why we
      weren’t doing anything, but we’re ready now. </p>

    <p>HMF: When we met on the 2014 U.S.
      tour, I think you mentioned back then you were working on new Skyclad stuff…</p>

    <p>Steve: Yes. We had a few
      problems. Some of the band members had some health problems, things like that.</p>

    <p>HMF: I’m glad that everything
      (and everyone) is back on track…and at least you had some good time to write
      songs for Satan. So it sounded like the song “Atom by Atom” was written about
      some personal issues…</p>

    <p>Brian: Right. That one is about
      Alzheimer’s disease. </p>

    <p>HMF: Brian, you’ve mentioned that
      you and Russ do most of the lyrics, which often seem to discuss global themes,
      like “Devil’s Infantry” about terrorism. Now you are writing songs that draw on
      more personal subjects?</p>

    <p>Brian: Yes, it does work like
      that. You draw on those personal experiences. Writing lyrics for Satan is
      totally different than writing for Blitzkrieg, and I want to keep it totally
      different. I don’t want there to be crossover. For Satan, a lot of it does come
      from personal experience and personal opinions about what’s going on around the
      world. With Blitzkrieg, ideas come from maybe a book that I’ve read or a film that
      I’ve seen.</p>

    <p>HMF: Do you generally come up
      with lyrics and give them to the band…or Steve, do you come up with riffs and
      then put words to them?</p>

    <p>Brian: Usually the music comes
      first. With Blitzkrieg, sometimes I’ll give a lyric to the guys and they’ll
      write the music that goes with it, or sometimes we’ll write them together as we
      work out the song, or sometimes the music comes first. With Satan, it’s always
      the music that comes first. </p>

    <p>HMF: Steve, do you have a concept
      in mind when you’re writing a song?</p>

    <p>Steve: I don’t really think about
      it in that way. It always starts with the riff. That’s what will come first.</p>

    <p>HMF: So when you have a song
      idea, do you have to decide if it will be for Satan or for Skyclad? The styles
      are quite different, but…</p>

    <p>Steve: Well, Russ is sort of the
      leader for Satan, so I’ll just throw riffs and bits to him and he uses them how
      he wants. It’s different than Skyclad, where I’m the leader and have to sort
      all that out. It’s kind of nice to be able to toss my ideas over to Russ.</p>

    <p>Brian: That really is the nice
      thing about Satan – it’s about five people. Like Steve just said, Skyclad is
      very much about his ideas. And I don’t say this in an egotistical way, but for
      Blitzkrieg I come up with ideas for what the songs should be about, and ideas
      for the concept of the album, and ideas for the artwork. But with Satan, it’s
      great to be able to say that it’s about five people, and we all put our ideas
      in and work together on it. It’s nice to be able to do that.</p>

    <p>HMF: Shared responsibility makes
      the process a little easier…even if you lose the vote on your favorite song!
      [laughs] </p>

    <p>Steve: Yeah! [laughs]</p>

    <p>HMF: Thanks so much for taking
      the time to chat today. Enjoy the rest of the tour – I’m already looking
      forward to seeing you guys again on your next visit to North America!</p>
