      <p>
        The Yale School of Art website is a site that anyone with Yale school credentiqls can edit. It has information
        about the
        Yale Art School, includijg oublications, how to apply, news, exhibitions, and events.
        All text is in boxes of differing colored backgrounds, with the background of the entire site being animated.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contrast: The contrat on this page is very bad, especially when the background animation is active.
          All the diferent text boxes and sections have different background colors, and they do not match well. The page is difficult to look at.</li>
        <li>Repetition: Most things are this page are not consistent. The font sizes, colors, and spacing are all different.
          If more of these things were repeated instead of all being different, the page would look much better.
        </li>
        <li>Alignment: The allignment of different sections of text on the webpage is strange in somepages. 
          Everything is aligned to the left, but the horizontal spacing is off in some spots. The page just looks weird because of this.</li>
        <li>Proximity: Everything is close together on th left half of the page. It feels like some of the sections and images are atuall too close togther to look good.</li>
