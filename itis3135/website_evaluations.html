      <p>
        The Apple.com webstie has information on all of Apple's available prodects, an online store to buy thse prodects, and a customer support section.

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contrast: The main colors the site uses are white, black, and grey. There is a good contracts between these colors, that is made even better 
          by the use of bright colors in different pictures and graphics of products being offered.
        </li>
        <li>Repetition: The font, colors, and size of text and pictures is consistent throught the webpage, giving it a nice look and making the page easy to navigate.</li>
        <li>Alignment: The alignment of differnt tabs, text, and images all match. This makes the page look sleek and clean.</li>
        <li>Proximity: Things on the page are spaced out enough so that it does not feel cramped, 
          but there is also enough room between the sections to easily be able to tell what pictures and text go with which product or section.</li>

        <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School of Art</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Yale School of Art website is a site that anyone with Yale school credentiqls can edit. It has information
        about the
        Yale Art School, includijg oublications, how to apply, news, exhibitions, and events.
        All text is in boxes of differing colored backgrounds, with the background of the entire site being animated.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contrast: The contrat on this page is very bad, especially when the background animation is active.
          All the diferent text boxes and sections have different background colors, and they do not match well. The page is difficult to look at.</li>
        <li>Repetition: Most things are this page are not consistent. The font sizes, colors, and spacing are all different.
          If more of these things were repeated instead of all being different, the page would look much better.
        </li>
        <li>Alignment: The allignment of different sections of text on the webpage is strange in somepages. 
          Everything is aligned to the left, but the horizontal spacing is off in some spots. The page just looks weird because of this.</li>
        <li>Proximity: Everything is close together on th left half of the page. It feels like some of the sections and images are atuall too close togther to look good.</li>
