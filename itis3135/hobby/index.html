            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Connor Kells, and I am a junior at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I am a huge
                music fan, and listening to music and going to see live music is a big hobby of mine. I played music in
                my middle school and high school bands, and I considered joinng the UNCC marching band, but the time
                commitment was too much for me. I regularly go to concerts whenevr I am able to and I listen to music
                frequently throughout the day. I took a music class my frshman year of college, and considered getting a
                music minor, but it did not end up working out because of the classes I wanted to take.

            <h3>My Introduction to Music</h3>
            <p>
                I have loved music for a long time. My parents both played instruments growing up. My mom played panio
                and my dad played trombone and drums. He actually still plays drums frequently in the soundproofed
                practice room we have in our basement. Starting when I was a kid, my parents would have music on
                frequently and would encourage my brother and I to listen to what we enjoyed. My dad would also take my
                brother and I to concerts we were interested in going to see, which definitely helped me grow to
                love music and concerts.

            <p>
                I went to my first realy concert when I was 7 or 8, and have been going frequently ever since. I go to
                even more shows now that I am an adult and can go own my own. Getting into music at a young age helped
                me make the choice to join the band in middle school. This was when I learned that I enjoyed playing
                music as well as listening to it. I am now a huge music fan in general, even though I am no longer in a
                band.

            <h3>Playing Music</h3>
            <p>
                I was hesitent to join the school band when I started middle school, but my parents convinced mw that it
                was worth at least trying it, saying that if I didnt enjoy it after the first year I could always choose
                a different class. I joined the middle school band and picked the clarinet as my starting instrument. I
                enjoyed the clainet alot, but it was pretty small and sometimes a few of the note were difficult for me
                to play because my hands are very big and it was causing issues for me. I switched to the bass clarinet,
                which is played the same way but it is alot larger. It is an octave lower than the normal clarinet,
                which I thought was very cool. I was selected for the All-County Honors band in middle school, and
                selected for the All-District Honors band in twice in high school. I also qualified to audition for the
                All-State Honors band in high school.

            <p>
                The highest level band at my high school was also the marching band. The band did not march with bass
                clarients, so I decided to play percussion during marching season. I did this for all three years in was
                in the marching band. Our band did very well, and won many of the competitions we went to. When the band
                did parades each year (the Raleigh Christmas parade and for school events) I would march with symbols,
                as the percusion pit was not involved in parades, and is seprate from the drumline.

            <h3>Favorite Genres</h3>
            <p>
                My favorite genre of music by far is heavy metal. I have been listening to metal for years, as my dad's
                favorite type of music is also metal. Because of this, I grew up listening to heavy metal bands like
                Iron Maiden, Fates Warning, and Colossus. Iron Maiden was one of the first metal bands I saw live, and
                it was an amazing show. A lot of people who like metal do not like the heiver side of the genre, so
                nothing heavier than thrash metal bands like Megadeth and Testament (both are awesome live!).
            </p>
            <figure>
                <a href="images/favgenres.jpeg">

            </figure>
            <p>
                After listening to metal for over a decade though, I do now enjoy alot of heavier sub-genres. This was
                not always the case, but in the last few years I have started to branch out more. These heavier
                subgenres include speed metal, thrash metal, melodic death metal, melodic black metal, and some older
                normal death metal bands. I am still not a huge fan of things like grindcore though, which includes
                bands like Exhumed and Cattle Decapitation. The heaviest genre I enjoy is deathcore, but only specific
                bands, such as Thy Art is Murder.

            <h3>Favorite Bands</h3>
            <p>
                Most of my favorite bands are from the genres mentioned in the "Favorite Genres" tab. Some of my
                favorite NWOBHM (New Wave of British Heavy Metal) bands include Iron Maiden, Spellcaster and Judas
                Priest. Some of my favorite heavier bands include Amon Amarth (melodic death metal), Death (classic
                death metal), Mors Pricipium Est (melodic death metal), and Arch Enemy (melodic death/thrash metal).
                I also listen to alot of thrash metal bands. Some of my favoirites include Slayer, Testament, Havok, and
                Kreator.

            </figure>
            <p>
                Some of my other favorite bands are actually from North Carolina. This means I am able to see them play
                live frequently, which I love. These include Mega Colossus, Knightmare, Children of the Reptile,
                Walpurgus, and Twisted Tower Dire. Most of these bands are NWOBHM bands. This means that they have a
                similar style to bands like Iron Maiden and Jusdia Priest, which I listed as some of my other favorites.
                I belive that I have seen Mega Colossus live more times than any other band by far. I have been going to
                their concerts for years.

            <h3>Live Music</h3>
            <p>I have always enjoyed going to concerts, and I go frequently when I am able to. I recently went to
                Raleigh to see a local band called Mega Colossus play. I have seen this band many times before and they
                always put on a good show. I am considering going to see Arch Ememy in Charlotte in April if I have
                time. I still goto concets with my dad when I am able to, as he was the one who used to take me to shows
                while I was growing up. There are alot of bands we both want to go see, so we will go to those shows
                together. I normally goto see the heavier death metal bands on my own though, because he is not into
                that type of music as much as I am. Depending on when the semester ends and my finals are finished, I
                may go see Mega Colossus again in May.
