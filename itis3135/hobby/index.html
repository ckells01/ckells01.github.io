            <h3>My Introduction to Music</h3>
            <p>
                I have loved music for a long time. My parents both played instruments growing up. My mom plyed panio
                and my dad played trombone and drums. He actually still plays drums frequently in the soundproffed
                practice room we have in our basement. Starting when I was a kid, my parents would have music on
                frequently and would encourage my brother and I to listen to what we enjoyed. My dad would also take my
                brothor and I to concerts we were interested in going to see, which definitrly helped me grow to
                love music and concerts.

            <h3>Playing Music</h3>
            <p>
                I was hesitent to join the school band when I started middle school, but my parents convinced mw that it
                was worth at least trying it, saying that if I didnt enjoy it after the first year I could always choose
                a different class. I joined the middle school band and picked the clarinet as my starting instrument. I
                enjoyed the clainet alot, but it was pretty small and sometimes a few of the note were difficult for me
                to play because my hands are very big and it was causing issues for me. I switched to the bass clarinet,
                which is played the same way but it is alot larger. It is an octave lower than the normal clarinet,
                which I thought was very cool. I was selected for the All-County Honors band in middle school, and
                selected for the All-District Honors band in twice in high school. I also qualified to audition for the
                All-State Honors band in high school.

                The highest level band at my high school was also the marching band. The band did not march with bass
                clarients, so I decided to play percussion during marching season. I did this for all three years in was
                in the marching band. Our band did very well, and won many of the competitions we went to. When the band
                did parades each year (the Raleigh Christmas parade and for school events) I would march with symbols,
                as the percusion pit was not involved in parades, and is seprate from the drumline.

            <h3>Favorite Genres</h3>
            <p>
                My favorite genre of music by far is heavy metal. I have been listening to metal for years, as my dad's
                favorite type of music is also metal. Because of this, I grew up listening to heavy metal bands like
                Iron Maiden, Fates Warning, and Colossus. Iron Maiden was one of the first metal bands I saw live, and
                it was an amazing show. My dad does not like more extreme metal, so nothing heavier than thrash metal
                bands like Megadeth and Testament (both are awesome live!). After listening to metal for over a decade
                though, I now enjoy alot of hevier sub-genres. These include speed metal, thrash metal, melodic death
                metal, melodic black metal, and some older normal death metal bands.

            <h3>Favorite Bands</h3>
            <p>
                Most of my favorite bands are from the genres mentioned in the "Favorite Genres" tab. Some of my
                favorite NWOBHM bands include Iron Maiden, Spellcaster and Judas Prient. Some of my favorite heavier
                bands include Amon Amarth (melodic death metal), Death (classic death metal), Mors Pricipium Est
                (melodic death metal), and Arch Enemy (melodic death/thrash metal).

            <h3>Live Music</h3>
            <p>I have always enjoyed going to concerts, and I go frequently when I am able to. I recently went to
                Raleigh to see a local band called Mega Colossus play. I have seen this band many times before and they
                always put on a good show. I am considering going to see Arch Ememy in Charlotte in April if I have
                time. I still goto concets with my dad when I am able to, as he was the one who used to take me to shows
                while I was growing up. There are alot of bands we both want to go see, so we will go to those shows
                together. I normally goto see the heavier death metal bands on my own though, because he is not into
                that type of music as much as I am.
