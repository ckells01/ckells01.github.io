      <ul>
        <li>No spaces or uppercase letters in file names or folder/directory names.</li>
        <li>No underlines on non-links.</li>
        <li>Files are managed well, with all files being in the project folder.</li>
        <li>No validation buttons included, but I do not think they are needed for this project as the website is being
          made for a client.</li>
        <li>On the Local Pools page, the content still needs to be updated, but this is already noted on the website.
        </li>
        <li>Styling and themes are consistent throughout the website.</li>

        <li>CRAP
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Constrast: </strong>Contrast is okay. Personally not a fan of the background color, but it does
              not clash and the text is easy to read.</li>
            <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>Repetition is good. Themes and styes and easy to recognize between pages.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>Alignment is consistent between pages and is done in a way that looks good.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>Things on the pages are spaced consistently and a good distance from each
              other that makes the pages seem full but not overly crowded. However, I feel that the spacing between the
              textboxes on the Contact Us page could be a bit smaller.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Aside from the background color, all page are designed well and consistently, with good content on each.</li>
        <li>Keep up the good work!</li>
      </ul>
