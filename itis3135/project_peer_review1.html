    <ul>
      <li>No spaces or uppercase letters in file names or folder/directory names.</li>
      <li>No underlines on non-links.</li>
      <li>Files are managed well, with all files being in the project folder.</li>
      <li>No validation buttons included, but I do not think they are needed for this project as the website is being made for a client.</li>
      <li>On the Gallery page, most f the pictures are the same size, but a few are landscape and move the caption down off the page depending on how far down the user has scrolled.</li>
      <li>Styling and themes are consistent throughout the website.</li>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Constrast: </strong>Contrast is very good. Text and backgroud colors go well together and make things easy to read.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>Repetition isn't super obvious on certain pages but on Gallery we can see consistent placement/pattern of the images and caption. Also on the FAQ page it has consistent design of the headers and content below it.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>The alignment is consistent on their individual pages but on the gallery page it implements an alternating image pattern. FAQ center aligns everything and has consistent alignment.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>The webpage has good proximity since it has individual pages for those items. On those page everything is placed close to each other and makes sense as to why they are close together.</li>
      </ul>

      <li>Every page has their header, main, and footer. There is also a navigation bar that repeats in each page.</li>
      <li>Since this is a webpage made for a client there isn't a needed brand header or tagline.</li>
    </ul>
