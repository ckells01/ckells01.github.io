      <ul>
        <li>No spaces or uppercase letters in file names or folder/directory names.</li>
        <li>No underlines on non-links.</li>
        <li>Files are managed well, with all files being in the project folder.</li>
        <li>No validation buttons included, but I do not think they are needed for this project as the website is being made for a client.</li>
        <li>On the Gallery page, most of the pictures are the same size, but a few are landscape and move the caption down off the page depending on how far down the user has scrolled.</li>
        <li>Styling and themes are consistent throughout the website.</li>

        <p>CRAP</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Constrast: </strong>Contrast is very good. Text and backgroud colors go well together and make things easy to read.</li>
          <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>Repetition is good. Themes and styes and easy to recognize between pages.</li>
          <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>The alignment is consistent on their individual pages but on the gallery page it implements an alternating image pattern. FAQ center aligns everything and has consistent alignment.</li>
          <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>Things on the pages are spaced consistently and a good distance from each other that makes the pages seem full but not overly crowded. </li>
        </ul>

        <li>Every page has their header, main, and footer. There is also a navigation bar that repeats in each page.</li>
        <li>Since this is a webpage made for a client there isn't a needed brand header or tagline.</li>
      </ul>
